## About the Video Course
This course gives you an understanding of vSphere foundation concepts. VMware vSphere is everywhere. Non-virtualized datacenters are a thing of the past, and in order to stay relevant you must understand vSphere. This course builds off my Clear and Simple vSphere Certified Associate videos, and gives you a deeper understanding of vSphere. You will learn about vSphere concepts such as host clustering, High Availability (HA), vMotion, and Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS). I will also provide live demos of many common tasks that you may need to perform as a vSphere Administrator using the vSphere Web Client.This course will also help you prepare for the VMware vSphere 6.5 Foundatations exam.
