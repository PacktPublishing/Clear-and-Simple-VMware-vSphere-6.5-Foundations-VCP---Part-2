00:00.290 --> 00:05.730
In this video I'll be explaining VSD for data protection and how it can be used as a backup solution

00:05.730 --> 00:13.710
for your virtual machines for data protection is a Virtual Machine backup solution that is completely

00:13.710 --> 00:15.500
integrated with the sphere.

00:15.750 --> 00:19.080
It's managed using the vees fair web client.

00:19.120 --> 00:25.420
Now we have to deploy a virtual machine called the VSE for data protection appliance.

00:25.420 --> 00:33.530
And this is a pre-built prepackaged Linux virtual machine that will use to manage vse for data protection

00:35.730 --> 00:41.750
we'll set up backup jobs for virtual machines and after those VMs are initially backed up only the change

00:41.750 --> 00:43.290
two blocks are copied.

00:43.320 --> 00:44.300
Moving forward.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.420
So we can do incremental backups.

00:47.720 --> 00:52.400
It provides virtual machine protection as well as file level protection.

00:52.400 --> 00:59.180
If we install and in guest agent and we can also do application where backups for sequel's Sharepoint

00:59.180 --> 01:02.650
in exchange if that guest agent is installed.

01:02.900 --> 01:07.070
This is a new feature for VSE for data protection.

01:07.070 --> 01:13.430
These applications are where backups used to only be available in a product called Vee's for data protection

01:13.430 --> 01:14.670
advanced.

01:14.690 --> 01:21.020
Now all of the features of these for data protection Advanced have been rolled into the VSE for data

01:21.020 --> 01:28.020
protection product which is free with VSE for.

01:28.070 --> 01:34.790
So we have to deploy the VSE fear and data protection appliance which is a pre-built Linux based virtual

01:34.790 --> 01:41.150
appliance we can deploy up to 20 of these virtual appliances per pervy center instance and by default

01:41.170 --> 01:47.960
they are equipped with 4 gigs of memory and for virtual C-p use each Vee's for data protection appliance

01:47.960 --> 01:57.110
supports a maximum of 8 terabytes of backup data per appliance which on average is 150 to 200 virtual

01:57.110 --> 01:58.020
machines.

02:00.160 --> 02:07.150
These for data protection is compatible with VSE VM FS and NFZ data stores.

02:07.210 --> 02:13.000
So let's take a look and an example back up job and we'll also take a look at a screenshot of a retention

02:13.000 --> 02:15.660
policy.

02:15.670 --> 02:22.180
So the first step is to pick out what we want to back up which can be either a virtual machine or a

02:22.180 --> 02:26.330
container object such as resource pool.

02:26.430 --> 02:29.210
Then we can schedule the frequency of the backup job.

02:29.210 --> 02:32.120
How often do we want backups to occur.

02:32.480 --> 02:38.830
And in a moment I'll show you a screen shot of a potential retention policy that we can configure.

02:38.890 --> 02:44.560
But before I show you that a few other options on the backup job that we can configure is replication

02:45.190 --> 02:53.620
we can replicate backed up data using these for data protection to either another Vee's for data protection

02:53.620 --> 02:57.510
appliance or even to EMC Avatar's solution.

02:58.740 --> 03:06.100
Any of this replicated data is compressed and encrypted and once we've created a backup job we can clone

03:06.100 --> 03:13.020
it and this will make it easy to configure future backup jobs with a matching retention policy.

03:13.090 --> 03:19.060
So here we see our retention policy and this is a good example of a fairly typical retention policy

03:19.540 --> 03:25.690
where we're going to save a certain number of daily backups a certain number of backups for weeks a

03:25.690 --> 03:29.580
certain number of monthly backups in a certain number of annual backups

03:32.590 --> 03:40.700
piece for data protection does allow us to perform application backups of sequel Exchange and SharePoint

03:41.780 --> 03:48.590
in order to do this we need to install the VSD for data protection application agents in the guest operating

03:48.590 --> 03:57.560
system and the job of this agent is to ensure that the data is in an application consistent state prior

03:57.560 --> 04:04.940
to backing that data up and may need to commit certain transaction logs to prepare those particular

04:04.940 --> 04:08.170
applications for backup.

04:08.240 --> 04:16.850
It supports sequel server Klosters and Exchange Server database availability groups and it can also

04:16.850 --> 04:22.960
be installed on physical exchange sequel and Sharepoint servers as well.

04:25.210 --> 04:32.720
Now we don't just have the ability to do VM level backups we can also restore individual files and folders.

04:32.740 --> 04:39.010
However this does require a client installation on the guest operating system and once we've taken these

04:39.010 --> 04:39.610
backups.

04:39.610 --> 04:43.750
A web based client can be used to perform these resource.

04:43.900 --> 04:50.050
As a matter of fact we can even give our end users access to a simple web interface so that they can

04:50.050 --> 04:57.400
perform their own self-service restores files can be restored to the original location or we can choose

04:57.400 --> 05:00.850
a different folder to place them in.

05:01.050 --> 05:06.810
So in review these for data protection provides backup and recovery for virtual machines.

05:06.840 --> 05:13.380
It's completely integrated into vse fair and is managed using the VSE for web client the VSE for data

05:13.380 --> 05:18.450
protection appliance is required and only changed blocks are backed up.

05:18.450 --> 05:25.320
We have incremental backups once a complete backup of a VM is performed each time the backup window

05:25.320 --> 05:26.140
arrives.

05:26.190 --> 05:33.010
The change to blocks are backed up and saved to a duplicated backup data location.

05:35.740 --> 05:40.330
These are data protection provides virtual machine and file level rephrase

05:43.580 --> 05:48.250
vse for data protection provides virtual machine and file level protection.

05:48.360 --> 05:53.860
The file level protection however does require the installation of unguessed agent.

05:54.300 --> 05:57.220
So do application aware backups for sequel.

05:57.270 --> 05:58.890
SharePoint and Exchange.
