00:01.800 --> 00:09.660
In this video we'll take a look at the proactive ha feature that is now available in these first five.

00:09.900 --> 00:16.860
And so here you can see I'm under the hosts and cluster's view and I'm looking at my H.A. cluster and

00:16.860 --> 00:23.070
I'm going to go ahead and click on edit and we'll take a look at the cluster settings here.

00:23.270 --> 00:29.530
And one of the settings that we have the ability to configure is to turn on proactive ha.

00:29.780 --> 00:32.920
But you can see here there is a prerequisite to that.

00:33.290 --> 00:35.850
We have to have dress enabled first.

00:36.140 --> 00:42.710
So I'm going to start by simply just enabling dress in manual mode.

00:42.730 --> 00:51.700
OK so now I've configured my cluster to enable D or s in manual mode and I'm going to go ahead and go

00:51.700 --> 00:57.070
to the other screen here and now turn on proactive high availability as well.

00:57.070 --> 01:00.930
And so here's what proactive ha is going to do for me.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.990
High Availability is normally.

01:03.990 --> 01:05.480
Service impacting.

01:05.610 --> 01:11.160
Right you can see here we have all of these conditions that we can configure like for example if a host

01:11.160 --> 01:12.020
fails.

01:12.120 --> 01:15.390
We want our virtual machines to restart.

01:15.390 --> 01:24.330
Right so all of these responses that we see here other than proactive ha involve restarting of Virtual

01:24.330 --> 01:33.470
Machine This changes in these first six top five or higher visibility now has the capability of detecting

01:34.010 --> 01:37.530
hardware problems inside of your ESX I host.

01:37.700 --> 01:46.890
And this can allow you to get the virtual machines off of a host before it creates an outage proactive.

01:46.930 --> 01:47.500
Ha.

01:47.500 --> 01:56.380
Works with hardware vendors to monitor the health status of things like your power supply or the fans

01:56.590 --> 02:06.370
in an ESX host and if one of those components fails we can leverage Diyar Ross to migrate the virtual

02:06.370 --> 02:08.210
machines off of that host.

02:08.440 --> 02:15.100
So you'll see in the configuration that I've established here right now the automation level is manual

02:15.490 --> 02:19.920
right which means you're going to have to approve any changes.

02:20.350 --> 02:25.420
But I'm going to go ahead and change it to automate it that way.

02:25.420 --> 02:35.260
If there is some kind of health problem with one of my ESX I host the virtual machines will move automatically.

02:35.300 --> 02:43.550
So now that I've enabled proactive ha and I've configured it to be automated now I can configure the

02:43.550 --> 02:47.340
remediation and we have a few different options here.

02:47.510 --> 02:55.730
So the first option is quarantine mode for all failures and this basically means that if proactive ha

02:55.730 --> 03:03.920
detects some sort of failure on an ESX host it will not power up any new Reems on that host and it will

03:03.920 --> 03:11.180
also attempt to move virtual machines off of that host as long as it doesn't create any performance

03:11.180 --> 03:12.710
issues.

03:12.710 --> 03:16.320
So this is a really conservative way to do this.

03:16.340 --> 03:22.900
Right if a host reports one of these problems we're going to try and get virtual machines off it.

03:22.950 --> 03:26.010
We're not going to power up any new VMS on that host.

03:26.130 --> 03:33.000
But if migrating VMS off of that host will create a performance issue that won't happen.

03:34.190 --> 03:42.800
So VMS may continue to run that host that has an issue or we could say you know what let's do this quarantine

03:42.800 --> 03:49.660
mode for moderate problems in maintenance mode for severe problems.

03:49.670 --> 03:56.940
So if if a problem that is qualified as a moderate occurs the host is going to be quarantined right.

03:56.960 --> 04:03.500
Meaning no VMS will boot up on it and it will migrate as many CMS off of that host as possible.

04:03.740 --> 04:09.230
As long as it doesn't create a performance issue but if there is a severe failure that host is going

04:09.230 --> 04:14.900
to enter may in its mode and that means that every Virgine machine will be evacuated from it and no

04:14.900 --> 04:16.790
VMS can boot up on it.

04:16.820 --> 04:21.890
And the third option is we can just be really aggressive and say you know what if there's any failure.

04:22.160 --> 04:24.310
Go ahead and place the host in maintenance mode.

04:24.830 --> 04:30.530
And that means no CMS can run that host or any virtual machines running out it will be automatically

04:30.530 --> 04:32.520
migrated off.

04:32.530 --> 04:38.950
So that's proactive ha and kind of the thought process here is looking to avoid outages rather than

04:38.950 --> 04:46.450
just responding to those outages we're trying to set up our cluster to actually avoid a failure of our

04:46.450 --> 04:48.290
virtual machines.

04:48.310 --> 04:49.490
So I just said Okay.

04:49.570 --> 04:52.740
And then proactive ha will be enabled on my cluster.
