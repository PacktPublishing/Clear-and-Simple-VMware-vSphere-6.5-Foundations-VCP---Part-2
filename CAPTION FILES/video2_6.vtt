In this video I'll demonstrate how to perform a storage Wii motion.

00:05.530 --> 00:08.750
So let's take a look at our hosts and Klosters view.

00:09.130 --> 00:14.830
And here you can see we've got a couple of ESX I host and we've got a virtual machine called Wii motion

00:14.830 --> 00:23.020
demo and the Wii motion demo virtual machine exists on my shared data store currently.

00:23.500 --> 00:27.860
And I can validate that by expanding the VM hardware here.

00:28.550 --> 00:35.350
And when we look at hard disk 1 we can see that it's stored on our shared data store.

00:35.440 --> 00:38.120
So that's where my VM is currently located.

00:38.440 --> 00:45.030
And let's say in this scenario I'd like to relocate this virtual machines files.

00:45.040 --> 00:52.630
So here we see the shared data store and if we look at files we can see all of the files associated

00:52.630 --> 00:57.650
with this virtual machine in the folder that has the same name as the VM.

00:57.760 --> 00:58.190
Right.

00:58.450 --> 01:02.740
So we've got things like the VM DK file the VM X File.

01:02.890 --> 01:09.020
All these critical files that my virtual machine needs in order to function.

01:09.250 --> 01:14.050
And so what I want to do is take those files in a while the virtual machine is running.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.650
Migrate them to one of these other data stores.

01:19.410 --> 01:23.580
So that's what we're going to do in the scenario that we're going to take this Wii motion demo virtual

01:23.580 --> 01:29.340
machine and we're going to migrate all of the data and the virtual machine is going to remain on the

01:29.340 --> 01:30.440
same host.

01:30.450 --> 01:35.580
It's not going to move to a different host but all the files are going to move to a different data store.

01:36.630 --> 01:46.090
So I right click to my VM chose migrate and now I'm going to click on change storage only and I'll hit

01:46.090 --> 01:47.260
next.

01:47.260 --> 01:52.220
And here we can see the possible data stores that I can migrate this virtual machine to.

01:52.570 --> 01:55.230
So I'm going to choose data store one.

01:55.360 --> 02:00.760
And at this point I can actually change the format of the desk.

02:00.850 --> 02:05.860
So if I want to take this virtual disk and thick provisioning or thin provision at this point I can

02:05.860 --> 02:06.340
do that.

02:06.490 --> 02:12.650
I'm going to go ahead and choose then provision and I'll hit next and I'll finish.

02:12.790 --> 02:16.710
And that's going to kick off my storage Wii motion.

02:16.810 --> 02:23.500
So now that my stored Wii motion has been kicked off how long it takes really is going to depend on

02:23.500 --> 02:26.900
the amount of data that you have on your virtual disk.

02:26.950 --> 02:34.000
This particular virtual machine has a 10 gig virtual disk and we're actually only using 4 gigs of data

02:34.150 --> 02:35.670
and it's extremely small.

02:35.830 --> 02:39.570
That's by design so that I can easily demonstrate everything.

02:39.880 --> 02:42.480
So we can see it happen almost immediately.

02:42.490 --> 02:47.710
Right now I can see my virtual machine has been relocated to a different data store.

02:48.040 --> 02:50.130
The VM never stopped running right.

02:50.350 --> 02:53.540
And the storage the motion was completed.

02:53.550 --> 03:00.920
Now one final thing I just want to point out if we click on monitor for this virtual machine you can

03:00.920 --> 03:03.140
schedule this as a task as well.

03:03.320 --> 03:11.250
So I could create a new scheduled task I could choose migrate and I could migrate to a different data

03:11.250 --> 03:13.900
store as a scheduled task as well.

03:16.970 --> 03:22.910
So for example I could move it back to my shared data store and I could schedule it to happen some time

03:22.910 --> 03:24.460
later tonight.

03:24.460 --> 03:31.370
All right so for example let's go ahead and just set it for let's say 10:50 p.m. and this is something

03:31.580 --> 03:41.480
that is often a good idea with storage v. Motion's because storage of emotions can be really really

03:41.480 --> 03:47.690
resource intensive where you're taking a lot of data in certain cases and moving it from one data store

03:47.690 --> 03:48.650
to another.

03:48.740 --> 03:54.650
You might not want to do that in the middle of the day because it might introduce enough storage related

03:54.650 --> 04:00.740
work that it's actually going to slow down the way that your virtual machines operate.

04:00.740 --> 04:01.390
Right.

04:01.780 --> 04:05.480
So scheduling these for later isn't necessarily a bad idea.

04:05.520 --> 04:11.720
Lots of times it make sense to schedule a sort of emotion to occur sometime during whatever your maintenance

04:11.760 --> 04:12.330
window is.
