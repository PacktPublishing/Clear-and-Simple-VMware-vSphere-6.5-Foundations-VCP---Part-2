In this video we'll learn how to reset the ESX time management agents and we'll also learn their purpose

00:07.180 --> 00:08.580
and what they're used for.

00:11.390 --> 00:20.950
So ESX I host management agents run on our ESX I hosts and these are what allow the host to synchronize

00:20.950 --> 00:23.240
its status with the center.

00:23.360 --> 00:29.790
So the center needs to be aware of many things happening on the ESX I host.

00:29.930 --> 00:36.920
And if you suddenly lose the ability to manage your host through the center or something along those

00:36.920 --> 00:42.170
lines you might actually need to restart these management agents.

00:42.620 --> 00:49.310
Think of them like a service that runs on the ESX I host that at times may need to get restarted for

00:49.310 --> 00:56.540
troubleshooting purposes and theres a couple of different ways that you can restart the services.

00:56.550 --> 01:05.460
Now the most common way is to use the direct console user interface or DSU y to restart services.

01:05.460 --> 01:12.570
That's the simplest way and probably the most frequently used but you can also do it via the command

01:12.570 --> 01:13.220
line.

01:13.230 --> 01:20.430
So here are a couple of commands that you can issue to restart hostie and veep's say on your ESX host

01:21.430 --> 01:28.420
and if you take a look at knowledge base article 1 0 0 0 3 4 9 0.

01:28.630 --> 01:35.200
It will explain how to carry out both of these methods to restart the management agents.

01:35.200 --> 01:40.510
If you're going to use the command line option it's pretty straightforward you'll just connect to your

01:40.510 --> 01:49.290
host using an S-sh client such as puttee and you have to enable S-sh on the ESX host first.

01:49.350 --> 01:55.050
But once you've done that you can connect to the host via poddy log in with the root credentials and

01:55.050 --> 02:02.640
then simply execute the two commands shown here and that can be useful especially in situations where

02:02.640 --> 02:08.330
you're not sitting in the data center and you don't have access to the DC UI.

02:08.420 --> 02:15.270
And so if you can't get remote console access or if you're not physically nearby the host the command

02:15.270 --> 02:20.500
line is a great way to quickly and easily do this remotely.

02:20.970 --> 02:26.040
Here's a look at the direct console user interface right.

02:26.050 --> 02:30.480
And here you can see I put a little red block around troubleshooting options.

02:30.820 --> 02:37.300
So when you log into the DC Why you'll just use the arrow keys to kind of scroll down here and get to

02:37.300 --> 02:42.280
troubleshooting options and then you'll hit enter and other troubleshooting options.

02:42.280 --> 02:46.210
We have the option to just restart the management agents.

02:46.270 --> 02:54.490
Now if you've never used the DC before all you need to do is hook up a keyboard and a monitor to the

02:54.490 --> 02:58.330
back of your ESX host and that will get you into the DC y.

02:58.630 --> 03:07.780
Or if you have drak or EPM I or some other sort of remote console solution you can use that as well.
