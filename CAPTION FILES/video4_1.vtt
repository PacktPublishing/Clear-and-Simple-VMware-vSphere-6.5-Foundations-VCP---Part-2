00:02.720 --> 00:09.830
In this video we'll let her out ESX I host logs and how we can export these logs and use them with VM

00:09.830 --> 00:11.600
war support.

00:11.800 --> 00:19.090
And that's the most common scenario in which you're going to be exporting these logs is a situation

00:19.150 --> 00:22.670
in which VM war support has asked you to do so.

00:22.810 --> 00:23.430
Right.

00:23.470 --> 00:25.570
These logs are complicated.

00:25.790 --> 00:26.830
They're hard to read.

00:26.830 --> 00:33.250
They're hard to understand and most of the time your best bet if you're dealing with these logs is to

00:33.400 --> 00:39.640
send a motive here or support most of the time if if they are working with you they're going to request

00:39.670 --> 00:46.890
that you can export these logs and maybe even a log bundle and send them over to them as well.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.210
And that's what the diagnostic bundle is.

00:49.210 --> 00:55.210
It's simply a collection of all logs all of the troubleshooting information that V.M. or could possibly

00:55.210 --> 00:56.170
need.

00:56.170 --> 01:00.930
Often they'll ask you to generate a diagnostic bundle and send it over to them.

01:00.970 --> 01:07.510
You can even upload them directly from the vees for a web client to a support request.

01:08.720 --> 01:15.470
And so this is an old practice here with these fair and as you can tell by the number of the Knowledge

01:15.470 --> 01:19.420
Base article this K.B. has been around for a long time.

01:19.470 --> 01:20.160
Right.

01:20.270 --> 01:23.390
Most of the cases now are six digits long.

01:23.390 --> 01:26.590
This is a knowledge base article 6:53.

01:26.810 --> 01:28.680
So this one has been around for a while.

01:28.880 --> 01:35.020
Let's take a quick look at the Kaybee article that walks you through the process of uploading logs.

01:37.060 --> 01:40.360
OK so here we see knowledgebase article 6:53.

01:40.390 --> 01:47.620
We can see it's been updated as of February 2016 and if we scroll down a little bit you can see that

01:47.620 --> 01:54.370
it walks you through a number of different processes for different versions of ESX high right and right

01:54.370 --> 01:57.500
off the bat you're probably thinking oh here's the vees for a client.

01:57.550 --> 02:00.220
That's not the kind of work for me.

02:00.270 --> 02:02.440
No we're going to have to use a different method here.

02:02.620 --> 02:08.980
So here's the method to obtain diagnostic information using the Vee's for a web client and you can see

02:08.980 --> 02:10.470
it's very straightforward right.

02:10.480 --> 02:17.770
You're simply going to go to hosts and Gloucester's you'll pick the host that you want to export the

02:17.770 --> 02:23.850
logs from or you can pick an entire set for instance and on the right hand side you've got the actions

02:23.860 --> 02:24.280
button.

02:24.460 --> 02:30.010
Or you can even just right click the host or the V Center instance and go to actions.

02:30.130 --> 02:35.630
And under all the center actions you'll find the export system logs action.

02:36.010 --> 02:42.610
And what that will do is it'll give you a few options of what exactly you want to gather.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.490
You know do you want to pull performance data or not.

02:45.490 --> 02:52.000
At which point you'll generate the log bundle and that is simply the sender putting all of those logs

02:52.000 --> 03:01.030
together once it's generated you have the ability to download it and from there you can upload the results

03:01.030 --> 03:11.960
to VM were using their SFP or anti-peace site which is detailed and base article 1 0 0 8 5 2 5 that

03:12.330 --> 03:18.840
that KB article will walk you through the process of actually uploading your diagnostic logs.

03:19.350 --> 03:21.880
Really simple and straightforward process.

03:22.650 --> 03:27.680
When you go to your support request you can choose the upload files option right.

03:27.730 --> 03:31.540
And then you can simply upload all of your diagnostic logs to them.

03:31.540 --> 03:37.570
You'll see this little progress bar going as they're being uploaded and when you're done you'll notice

03:37.570 --> 03:42.910
that in your support request there will be an entry basically saying you know at a certain point in

03:42.910 --> 03:47.320
time the requester up loaded the required support locks.
