In this video I'll explain Dior as a virtual machine and group affinity rules when we enable Diyar rests

00:09.170 --> 00:11.580
on a cluster of ESX hosts.

00:11.690 --> 00:16.310
We're going to allow press to automatically take virtual machines and move them around.

00:17.640 --> 00:23.040
And this could potentially create some unexpected results.

00:23.040 --> 00:30.600
So for example in our slide here we see four ESX high hosts and we have two domain controllers running

00:30.600 --> 00:31.900
as virtual machines.

00:32.010 --> 00:39.770
And at the moment there are different ESX high hosts when we enable fully automated Diyar as we're going

00:39.770 --> 00:46.030
to allow virtual machines to be automatically Vae motion from host to host.

00:46.060 --> 00:51.970
So we have the possibility that domain controller 2 and domain controller one could end up on the same

00:51.970 --> 00:53.800
ESX I host.

00:53.940 --> 00:56.460
And if that ESX I host word fail.

00:56.590 --> 01:01.470
Well now we've lost both of our domain controllers.

01:01.540 --> 01:08.920
So when we automate certain things like DRM when we allow virtual machines to be automatically moved

01:08.920 --> 01:16.120
around we may need to think about what could potentially go wrong and create some rules that govern

01:16.120 --> 01:25.480
this behavior and anti affinity rule would force these virtual machines to remain on different hosts.

01:25.480 --> 01:30.730
So that's definitely something you should consider for any virtual machines that serve I redundant purpose

01:31.000 --> 01:36.580
such as domain controllers.

01:36.600 --> 01:41.400
We can also create affinity rules that are enforced on a wider scale.

01:41.460 --> 01:50.560
So for example we could create the IRS groups of hosts on the left hand side we have three ESX hosts

01:50.650 --> 01:55.080
that have been grouped together as our production hosts on the right hand side.

01:55.090 --> 02:02.090
We have three ESX hosts that are our development hosts and we can also create groups of virtual machines

02:02.090 --> 02:07.510
as well and we can say all of our production VMP must run on the production hosts

02:10.230 --> 02:13.530
Well what if those ESX hosts fail.

02:13.830 --> 02:21.630
Now I've created a group of virtual machines and a group of VSX I hosts and I've created a group of

02:21.630 --> 02:29.890
finity rule that says the production venoms must run on the production host.

02:30.110 --> 02:40.380
If those production hosts were to fail those virtual machines would not restart the development hosts.

02:40.420 --> 02:46.060
Now we do have another way that we can set up a group affinity role.

02:46.470 --> 02:50.580
The rule that I've just described is called the required affinity rule.

02:50.580 --> 02:56.550
That means that these virtual machines must run on the production host and they cannot run on the development

02:56.550 --> 02:58.140
hosts for any reason.

02:59.890 --> 03:06.870
I could create a preferential affinity rule that would have a similar effect.

03:07.030 --> 03:15.070
However preferential affinity rules can be violated if a high availability event occurs.

03:15.070 --> 03:16.420
So what does that mean.

03:17.390 --> 03:22.550
Well in that circumstance if the three production hosts were to fail high availability could actually

03:22.550 --> 03:25.250
restart these virtual machines on the development hosts.
