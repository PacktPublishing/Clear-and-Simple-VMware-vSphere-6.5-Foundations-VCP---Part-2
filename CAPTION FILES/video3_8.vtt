00:00.300 --> 00:06.500
In this video I'll demonstrate some common troubleshooting options for virtual machines.

00:06.570 --> 00:10.400
We're going to start by looking at this virtual machine called the motion demo.

00:11.040 --> 00:17.150
And one of the first troubleshooting steps that I like to take when I look at a virtual machine.

00:17.910 --> 00:22.650
Is to determine if it has VM or tools installed on it and you can see that this virtual machine does

00:22.650 --> 00:24.210
not.

00:24.300 --> 00:26.970
So what does that mean for this particular VM.

00:27.060 --> 00:34.440
Well number one it means that if I console when my mouse and keyboard aren't really going to work as

00:34.440 --> 00:37.260
well as they would if I had VM or tools installed.

00:37.650 --> 00:38.870
That's really no big deal.

00:39.090 --> 00:46.680
But the other part that is more important is the balloon driver will not be installed on this virtual

00:46.680 --> 00:47.540
machine.

00:48.030 --> 00:55.470
And that means if there is a shortage of memory on the ESX host the host will not be able to perform

00:55.470 --> 00:56.790
ballooning on this Wii.

00:57.090 --> 01:03.450
And that essentially means that it won't be able to reclaim that memory from this virtual machine even

01:03.450 --> 01:06.570
if the virtual machine is no longer using that memory.

01:07.490 --> 01:16.220
So that's an important part of VM more tools to have that balloon driver installed on your vim's so

01:16.220 --> 01:20.360
we can see right here this virtual machine does not have VM or tools installed.

01:20.450 --> 01:23.840
It's very easy to install VM tools on a virtual machine.

01:23.840 --> 01:27.190
You can just right click it and right now the virtual machine is powered off.

01:27.200 --> 01:33.620
But you just right click it and go ahead and go to Guest OS and do install VM are tools.

01:33.780 --> 01:35.300
It's very simple.

01:35.300 --> 01:43.430
Another thing that I like to do edit the settings of this VM for Aviemore tools is make sure my VM are

01:43.450 --> 01:45.220
tools.

01:45.220 --> 01:48.050
Installation is always up to date.

01:48.050 --> 01:50.470
Right so you can go to the VM options here.

01:51.640 --> 01:59.950
And under VM tools you can choose to have VM or tools automatically upgrade every time this VM is powered

01:59.950 --> 02:00.530
on.

02:00.820 --> 02:08.360
Right so thats a great way to ensure that VM or tools is always consistently kept up to date

02:14.520 --> 02:15.750
while we're in here.

02:15.750 --> 02:19.900
Let's take a look at a couple other configuration options on this VM.

02:20.770 --> 02:30.730
Maybe I am having an issue V motioning this virtual machine to a different host that can occur if I've

02:30.760 --> 02:34.420
created a scheduling affinity for this VM.

02:34.420 --> 02:40.780
Also if I'm having performance issues on this virtual machine and it looks like CPQ you might be the

02:40.780 --> 02:44.600
problem maybe I've created a CPE limit.

02:45.580 --> 02:51.500
Maybe I've limited this VM to a certain amount of maigre hurts of CPQ usage.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.020
Or maybe I've given it a low number of shares.

02:55.030 --> 03:03.260
These are things that could definitely negatively impact the performance of this VM.

03:03.540 --> 03:07.310
Similar settings exist under memory.

03:07.670 --> 03:14.520
I can create memory limits so I could limit this VM to 20 megs of memory and if I do that the performance

03:14.520 --> 03:17.560
of the VM probably isn't going to be very good right.

03:17.760 --> 03:26.180
So memory limits CPQ limits those can all create potential problems and a change in my memory reservation

03:26.190 --> 03:27.110
back to zero.

03:27.330 --> 03:30.090
That's another really good thing to be aware of though.

03:30.210 --> 03:36.000
So if you'll notice when I came in here my virtual machine had a memory reservation.

03:36.270 --> 03:42.450
So let's take a moment to talk about what a virtual machines memory reservation actually does.

03:42.450 --> 03:48.430
So here we have a VM called the motion demo which is currently running on this host.

03:48.450 --> 03:56.230
Let's just call a host one or three and this host has a total of 19 gigs of memory available.

03:56.750 --> 04:01.660
So I'm going to go to my Wii motion demo VM and I'm going to right click the virtual machine and go

04:01.660 --> 04:02.730
to settings

04:07.070 --> 04:13.270
and we're going to go ahead and give this virtual machine a lot of memory and I'm going to give it 19

04:13.280 --> 04:19.450
gigs of memory which is pretty much the most that I could possibly support for virtual machine.

04:19.520 --> 04:24.980
ESX I host and I'll go ahead and give it a memory reservation as well.

04:25.120 --> 04:33.760
So I'm going to reserve all to memory basically saying if I've configured 19 gigs of memory for this

04:33.760 --> 04:38.030
VM we are going to guarantee this VM.

04:38.110 --> 04:41.140
19 gigs of memory all the time.

04:41.140 --> 04:45.710
Any time you boot this virtual machine up it's going to get that 19 gigs of memory.

04:46.300 --> 04:49.790
So we have now guaranteed this VM.

04:49.940 --> 04:53.450
19 gigs of memory at all times.

04:53.560 --> 04:58.260
So let's go ahead and power on this virtual machine and see what happens.

04:59.230 --> 05:04.210
So I just click the button the power on the VM and you'll notice here a little notification popped up

05:04.780 --> 05:07.950
power on virtual machine failed.

05:07.960 --> 05:12.250
So let's take a closer look and see why I was not able to power on this VM.

05:12.310 --> 05:18.120
Will go to monitor tasks and events and we're going to look at tasks

05:20.930 --> 05:22.590
and see what went wrong here.

05:24.530 --> 05:30.580
The host does not have sufficient memory resources to satisfy the reservation.

05:30.650 --> 05:37.280
I've configured a reservation on this via And that means that it also comes with something called admission

05:37.280 --> 05:38.070
control.

05:39.310 --> 05:43.770
Admission control is basically the guarantee part of this right.

05:43.870 --> 05:53.710
My VM can not boot up unless the host can actually satisfy this reservation that I've created so I've

05:53.720 --> 05:57.740
guaranteed this VM 19 gigs of memory any time that is powered up.

05:58.430 --> 06:04.850
But my host can't do that my hosts can't satisfy that memory reservation so let's change the memory

06:04.850 --> 06:11.000
reservation to something more more doable for my ESX host.

06:11.000 --> 06:15.150
Right now we can see we have 19 gigs of memory for this VM.

06:15.170 --> 06:17.690
I'm going to change it back to 4 gigs.

06:17.820 --> 06:18.660
OK.

06:19.340 --> 06:23.940
And now let's try and power on this VM and see if we're able to power on now.

06:24.500 --> 06:25.980
And it should work just fine.

06:26.150 --> 06:31.360
Because that's a reservation that this ESX host can definitely satisfy.

06:31.610 --> 06:36.550
So my VM is now successfully powered on.

06:36.640 --> 06:45.030
So for issues like not being able to power on a VM or general performance issues reservation's limits

06:45.080 --> 06:46.090
sharers.

06:46.120 --> 06:49.370
Those are all important configurations to take a look at.

06:50.910 --> 06:56.740
Here we see a second VM this VM is currently an old version of virtual hardware.

06:56.960 --> 07:04.590
Right that means it's not going to support some of the latest maximums and options that a virtual machine

07:04.710 --> 07:09.800
on the current version of virtual hardware would be able to support.

07:09.870 --> 07:17.180
So I'm going to Right-Click this virtual machine and go to edit settings and you'll notice that in the

07:17.240 --> 07:24.610
edit settings screen you have the ability to schedule a virtual hardware upgrade.

07:24.820 --> 07:30.710
The next time this VM boots up I can change the virtual hardware version to one of these newer versions

07:31.220 --> 07:35.250
like for example ESX I-65.

07:35.480 --> 07:41.090
So I'm going to go ahead and hit OK here and then next time I power on this VM the virtual hardware

07:41.090 --> 07:43.090
version is going to be updated.

07:44.960 --> 07:53.840
So let's go ahead and power on VM one will go to monitor and we'll look at tasks and events and will

07:53.840 --> 07:59.060
validate that the virtual machine is actually upgraded to the latest revision.

07:59.060 --> 08:03.710
And another way to actually look at this is we can just simply right click the virtual machine right

08:03.710 --> 08:05.750
now go to edit settings

08:09.380 --> 08:17.180
and you can see the virtual machines compatability mode listed here and now it V.M. version 13 compatible

08:17.180 --> 08:21.660
with ESX I 6.5.

08:21.660 --> 08:27.280
All right let's think about some other potential problems that could exist with our virtual machines.

08:27.360 --> 08:35.130
So let's say that you've decided hey I want to install a Windows Server 2012 on this VM.

08:35.310 --> 08:42.480
So I'm going right click the VM go to edit settings and when you create a virtual machine you're essentially

08:42.480 --> 08:44.470
creating virtual hardware.

08:45.030 --> 08:45.440
Right.

08:45.480 --> 08:54.570
So you may create a set of virtual hardware that's compatible with the 32 bit operating systems or 64

08:54.570 --> 09:01.200
bit operating systems if you don't have the right virtual hardware you're not going to be able to run

09:01.200 --> 09:03.350
your operating system.

09:03.370 --> 09:12.210
So here you can see for the guest OS version on this VM I've chosen Windows Server 2008 R2 64 bit if

09:12.210 --> 09:18.690
you choose the improper operating system when you create the VM that can cause some problems and you

09:18.690 --> 09:22.080
might not actually be able to boot up that operating system.

09:22.230 --> 09:28.200
So you can modify these here after the fact and I'm just going to go ahead and Right-Click VM one and

09:28.200 --> 09:29.600
power it off.

09:29.850 --> 09:36.240
You can modify the guest operating system selection here doesn't actually change the guest operating

09:36.240 --> 09:39.240
system that is running in a VM.

09:39.600 --> 09:45.310
It just changes the guest operating system designation of the VM itself.

09:48.100 --> 09:54.100
So we can go to edit settings here and we can modify the guest operating system now.

09:54.130 --> 10:00.230
Now you may notice that even after you change this you're still unable to boot your virtual machine.

10:00.340 --> 10:05.860
And sometimes if you don't choose the correct operating system initially you may actually need to blow

10:05.860 --> 10:12.380
away that VM and build a new virtual machine with the proper guest operating system selected.

10:17.640 --> 10:22.140
Now while we're looking at the settings for VM one there's just a couple other settings I want to take

10:22.140 --> 10:23.480
a quick look at.

10:23.770 --> 10:27.570
Here's our network adapter.

10:27.650 --> 10:34.130
Notice here we have a network adapter type that's not supported by Windows Server 2012.

10:34.610 --> 10:42.270
And so in this scenario we've got a network adapter you 1000 that's not actually supported anymore.

10:42.440 --> 10:47.900
So we may want to replace that with a different network adapter.

10:49.610 --> 10:50.810
And this time around

10:53.780 --> 11:00.320
we'll choose the VM X net three virtual network interface card type.

11:00.390 --> 11:08.860
So rather than choose the 1000 let's choose the VM x 3 which is really best practice in the vast majority

11:08.860 --> 11:13.640
of use cases and it's supported by just about every operating system now.

11:14.130 --> 11:22.970
And we'll go ahead and we'll hit OK so we can't change the type of virtual Nic after the fact but we

11:22.970 --> 11:25.360
can always create a new virtual neck.

11:25.640 --> 11:29.380
And then just go into the guest operating system and move our IP address over.
