00:00.530 --> 00:07.520
In this video I'll demonstrate how to configure DNS on an ESX I host cluster.

00:07.520 --> 00:15.860
So here you can see my cluster it currently contains 2 ESX I hosts and one of the really critical things

00:16.040 --> 00:22.970
that I have already set up in advance here is on my ESX I hosts I have actually set up a Wii motion

00:22.970 --> 00:23.940
network.

00:24.050 --> 00:30.650
So if we go to each host we look at the configure option and we go to our virtual switches here we can

00:30.650 --> 00:40.270
see on both hosts I have a port group called the 199 a group called V.M. network.

00:40.270 --> 00:46.420
And if I look at my other ESX I host I should see the identical configuration.

00:46.470 --> 00:56.550
So I've got the same port groups configured on both hosts and I've also got a VM kernel port that is

00:56.550 --> 00:58.970
marked for Wii motion.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.570
And each one of these ESX I host.

01:01.640 --> 01:02.260
Right.

01:02.310 --> 01:08.070
And that's critical because Diyar us is completely dependent on the motion.

01:08.120 --> 01:15.490
Right that's all d r S's is automatic Feme motion for the purposes of load balancing.

01:15.550 --> 01:18.760
So I've got my Wii motion network all ready to go.

01:18.760 --> 01:22.850
I've got my VM kernel ports created I'm in good shape there.

01:23.000 --> 01:29.160
So let's go back to the cluster itself and edit the configuration of the cluster.

01:29.360 --> 01:35.180
And I've named it ha cluster but I'm going to have DRM enabled on this cluster as well.

01:36.050 --> 01:38.690
And let's walk through the settings.

01:38.690 --> 01:42.830
So the first setting is whether or not we want to turn Diyar ass on.

01:42.950 --> 01:46.050
And in this case I've already enabled the.

01:46.170 --> 01:53.400
And then I can choose the Deros automation level the automation level is a very important setting and

01:53.400 --> 02:01.300
you can see here I have it configured for manual and in manual mode Diyar DRM will never automatically

02:01.330 --> 02:04.340
migrate virtual machines from host to host.

02:04.370 --> 02:04.680
Right.

02:04.830 --> 02:11.290
It will simply give you recommendations and you can manually choose whether or not you want to carry

02:11.290 --> 02:13.070
out those recommendations.

02:15.060 --> 02:22.130
Partially automated is a little bit different in that you're turning over more control to the center.

02:22.190 --> 02:22.510
Right.

02:22.530 --> 02:25.550
So it's partially automated dioramas.

02:25.740 --> 02:32.310
What's going to happen is as you power on virtual machines DNS will just automatically choose a host

02:32.400 --> 02:39.580
to place them on right so let's say you're powering on a virtual machine that's very memory intensive.

02:39.910 --> 02:45.900
Well dress will automatically select the ideal host in your cluster to run that virtual machine.

02:47.990 --> 02:54.820
Right and then we have a fully automated mode and in fully automated mode we're basically turning complete

02:54.820 --> 02:57.020
control over to the center.

02:57.140 --> 02:58.010
We're saying you know what.

02:58.000 --> 03:04.180
The sooner you can migrate virtual machines from host to host anytime you want carry out as many of

03:04.180 --> 03:06.350
the motions as are necessary.

03:06.400 --> 03:09.070
Doesn't matter what time of day it can be during business hours.

03:09.070 --> 03:10.820
It can be whenever.

03:10.970 --> 03:16.460
So with fully automated mode we're letting a lot of stuff happen automatically we're letting all of

03:16.460 --> 03:20.210
our emotions happen automatically without our approval.

03:22.830 --> 03:29.550
And then we can also choose the migration threshold so you can see here it's currently right in the

03:29.550 --> 03:30.730
middle right.

03:30.840 --> 03:35.310
And in most cases this is the optimal migration threshold.

03:35.520 --> 03:39.840
You really don't need to change this unless you have a really good reason to do so.

03:40.050 --> 03:41.490
Now you can change it if you want.

03:41.490 --> 03:46.000
Right we could go up to aggressiveness level 4.

03:46.260 --> 03:52.560
And that's going to make changes that promise even a moderate improvement to the load balancing but

03:52.560 --> 03:55.140
in most cases you know that's overkill right.

03:55.140 --> 04:01.660
So in most cases we'll just leave it at the default migration threshold and that should be just fine.

04:01.680 --> 04:05.530
We can also enable predictive diyas if we want.

04:05.540 --> 04:14.210
Right so DRM is going to look at forecasted metrics that are delivered from the Realize operations and

04:14.300 --> 04:20.000
move virtual machines proactively before resource contention even occurs.

04:20.090 --> 04:21.470
Pretty cool feature.

04:21.710 --> 04:24.420
I'm going to disable it in my lab.

04:24.710 --> 04:26.620
But that's a possible feature for real life.

04:26.630 --> 04:27.780
That might be helpful.

04:30.910 --> 04:32.680
Virtual Machine automation.

04:32.740 --> 04:42.840
Do we want the ability to override this de-risk cluster configuration for individual VM.

04:43.180 --> 04:50.490
So for example let's say I have a V Center server appliance deployed on a virtual machine.

04:50.610 --> 04:53.800
I might not want that to move from host to host right.

04:53.810 --> 05:00.640
I always want to know which host my center server or appliance VM is running on.

05:00.640 --> 05:00.860
Right.

05:00.900 --> 05:06.230
That way if I ever need to counsel then to have a rebooted or something like that I know where it is.

05:06.240 --> 05:14.550
So by checking this box we're basically saying we can go to individual VMS and configure settings for

05:14.550 --> 05:15.630
specific vim's.

05:15.640 --> 05:20.030
Right so maybe I'll put the center in manual dress mode.

05:20.130 --> 05:20.330
Right.

05:20.330 --> 05:24.290
So the only time it will move is if I actually manually approve it.

05:28.710 --> 05:35.040
Do we want to try an evenly distribute virtual machines across hosts for availability reasons.

05:35.040 --> 05:41.070
That's your call if you want to enable that or not do we want to load balance based on consumed memory

05:41.100 --> 05:44.480
rather than active memory of virtual machines.

05:44.740 --> 05:52.560
Really this is ideal for clusters where you have memory that's not over committed meaning you have a

05:52.560 --> 05:57.330
bunch of virtual machines and even if they all use their memory at once you still won't have a memory

05:57.330 --> 05:59.170
shortage right.

05:59.190 --> 06:04.200
So in that case I'm going to go ahead and just leave that as is and I'm going to hit OK on my cluster

06:04.200 --> 06:09.350
here and now I've been able to fully automated DRM.

06:09.810 --> 06:16.800
So if I go to my distress service here you can see it's unable and fully automated but.

06:16.890 --> 06:22.960
So let's go to the monitor tab and let's take a look at these fair.

06:24.120 --> 06:29.090
And right now I can hit run diarists and old tell me are there any recommendations right.

06:29.100 --> 06:31.660
Is there anything that should happen.

06:31.710 --> 06:35.950
Should I migrate VMS from host one to host two or anything like that.

06:36.060 --> 06:39.150
But there's no recommendations currently.

06:39.330 --> 06:46.830
If we were to configure DNS in manual mode we would see a list of recommendations here and then we could

06:46.830 --> 06:53.080
choose to manually apply those recommendations if there's any duress fault.

06:53.090 --> 06:54.100
We'll see those here.

06:54.100 --> 06:55.280
There's none right now.

06:55.280 --> 07:01.400
And this is really handy right once you enable fully automated Diyar as you may want to see what's actually

07:01.400 --> 07:01.980
going on.

07:02.000 --> 07:02.210
Right.

07:02.210 --> 07:05.210
What is the IRS doing within your cluster.

07:05.240 --> 07:06.920
What moves isn't making.

07:07.050 --> 07:12.100
So this is a good way to see all the moves that Demarest has made recently.

07:12.300 --> 07:18.900
And then we can also take a look at the CPI memory and network utilization and get an idea of how evenly

07:18.900 --> 07:22.480
the work load is distributed across the hosts in my cluster.

07:23.040 --> 07:25.350
So that's how we configure dress right.

07:25.350 --> 07:27.060
Pretty straightforward to set it up.

07:27.240 --> 07:33.270
If you're brand new to the IRS I always recommend starting it out in manual mode and letting it roll

07:33.270 --> 07:37.230
for a few days and keeping a close eye on the recommendations.

07:37.290 --> 07:37.530
Right.

07:37.560 --> 07:43.530
And then you'll have a really good idea of what's actually going to happen when you enable it and fully

07:43.530 --> 07:44.970
automated mode.

07:45.180 --> 07:50.430
And the other thing to remember is that Deros is just really Wii motion right.

07:50.430 --> 07:57.720
That's all it's doing is migrating virtual machines from host to host using Wii motion for load balancing.

07:57.750 --> 08:05.360
So if your Wii motion network is not set up correctly or if you've got CPQ affinity or local ISO images

08:05.360 --> 08:10.150
or things like that those things are all going to impact the.

08:10.350 --> 08:16.140
So you really need to make sure that all of your virtual machines on the cluster are properly configured

08:16.530 --> 08:19.680
for Wii motion prior to enabling DNS.
