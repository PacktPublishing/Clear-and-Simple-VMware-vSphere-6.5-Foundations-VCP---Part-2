00:02.010 --> 00:07.740
In this video we'll learn about VSD fair a high availability and how it can be used to protect our virtual

00:07.740 --> 00:12.380
machines from any ESX host failure.

00:12.390 --> 00:17.960
So the purpose of high availability is to protect our virtual machines from failures.

00:18.060 --> 00:25.450
But it does not provide 100 percent uptime ha is going to involve virtual machines rebooting.

00:25.460 --> 00:30.070
It's going to involve virtual machines potentially being down for a little while.

00:30.210 --> 00:36.950
If something like an ESX host failure occurs that there is going to be an outage associated with that

00:39.390 --> 00:47.160
what Ha does is essentially if an ESX host fails all of the virtual machines are running on that host

00:47.310 --> 00:48.260
will fail.

00:49.260 --> 00:56.670
But after the fact after that failure occurs high availability will start rebooting those virtual machines

00:57.180 --> 00:59.640
on different hosts within that cluster.

01:01.640 --> 01:08.360
You can protect your virtual machine from failures at the host level or you can even protect your virtual

01:08.360 --> 01:12.990
machines from virtual machine level failures with high availability.

01:13.250 --> 01:19.050
So you can actually monitor the status of VM or tools in your virtual machines.

01:19.370 --> 01:27.360
And if VM or tool stops responding that virtual machine can be rebooted right on the same host it's

01:27.360 --> 01:34.790
so H.A. can protect you from failures at either the host or virtual machine level.

01:34.920 --> 01:40.730
And we can use things like mission control to ensure that we have enough spare capacity right.

01:40.740 --> 01:48.590
So for example if you have a cluster of four hosts in one of those hosts fails we need to make sure

01:48.680 --> 01:59.960
that the surviving hosts have enough spare memory and CPQ capacity to acceptably run all of the virtual

01:59.960 --> 02:03.550
machines that used to be running on that host that has now failed.

02:03.890 --> 02:10.170
That's what we use at mission control for is to guarantee that we have spare available capacity.

02:12.490 --> 02:18.660
And one final point about H.A. it does not utilize Wii motion.

02:18.670 --> 02:22.930
Don't confuse H.A. with DRM or with the motion.

02:22.990 --> 02:30.100
High Availability does not utilize Wii motion in any way because Wii motion is used for running virtual

02:30.100 --> 02:36.060
machines and virtual machines that are up with high availability if a host fails.

02:36.060 --> 02:37.720
My virtual machines are down.

02:42.150 --> 02:45.720
So let's take a look at how high availability works.

02:45.900 --> 02:53.710
Here you can see I have a VM called V.M. 1 and my VM is running on host ESX size 0 1.

02:54.150 --> 02:58.080
And so we've got this VM running and right now everything is fine.

02:58.110 --> 03:07.050
My VM is working it's running on a host 1 and my VM also has access to all of its files that are down

03:07.050 --> 03:09.000
here on shared storage.

03:09.000 --> 03:09.280
Right.

03:09.430 --> 03:14.410
And by the way shared storage is required for H.A..

03:14.520 --> 03:23.130
So I have to have some sort of shared storage system that all of my hosts in the cluster have access

03:23.130 --> 03:23.910
to.

03:23.940 --> 03:29.080
So I've got shared storage I've got VM one running on ESX has ever one.

03:29.280 --> 03:35.770
And then something happens something goes wrong and ESX zero one fails right.

03:35.880 --> 03:45.550
So now my host that the VM one was running on is down and my VM can't run if the host is down.

03:45.570 --> 03:49.260
So VM one fails right along with that host

03:51.990 --> 03:58.020
so there's going to be some down time for this virtual machine and every other VM that was running on

03:58.020 --> 03:59.180
that host.

03:59.550 --> 04:05.360
And what's going to happen now is the virtual machines files are still intact.

04:05.360 --> 04:05.740
Right.

04:05.790 --> 04:15.540
The vim's running state or live state may have been affected but there's still a a set of files for

04:15.540 --> 04:23.080
this virtual machine that are intact that exist on shared storage and those files can be used to now

04:23.100 --> 04:29.970
boot up another instance of that virtual machine on some other ESX I host.

04:30.150 --> 04:32.980
And that's how high availability works.

04:33.530 --> 04:41.500
And when the host one fails hosts two or three or four one of them is going to be a master host that

04:41.500 --> 04:45.000
host is going to recognize that hey host one is down.

04:45.280 --> 04:51.400
Let's take all the victims that were running on that host will leverage their files which are still

04:51.400 --> 04:57.380
intact and will start booting up all those victims on the surviving hosts within that cluster.

05:03.080 --> 05:10.160
So now we're just going to take a very brief look at the architecture of high availability at a pretty

05:10.160 --> 05:11.230
high level here.

05:12.530 --> 05:20.180
And here we see V.M. kernel ports running on every host in my cluster and those VM kernel ports are

05:20.180 --> 05:22.110
marked for management traffic.

05:22.190 --> 05:28.640
And so what high availability is going to do is once we go hadn't we create our cluster right in the

05:28.640 --> 05:29.470
center.

05:29.480 --> 05:34.390
We go ahead and enable high availability on this cluster.

05:34.520 --> 05:41.580
Then at that point what will happen is once high availability is enabled an election will take place.

05:41.580 --> 05:49.440
And one of these hosts in the cluster will take on the role of master every other host in that cluster

05:49.960 --> 05:51.930
will take on the role of Slave

05:55.110 --> 06:02.550
The other thing that will happen when we enable high availability is the fault domain manager or FDM

06:03.080 --> 06:05.370
will start running on each of these hosts.

06:05.940 --> 06:13.220
And the Default Domain manager is basically responsible for these hosts communicating with each other.

06:13.530 --> 06:21.420
So the master hosts will be constantly sending heartbeats to all the slaves all of the slaves will constantly

06:21.420 --> 06:23.850
be sending heartbeats to the Master.

06:23.850 --> 06:24.220
Right.

06:24.420 --> 06:32.200
And and so basically this allows the master to know hey if any of the slaves are down the master will

06:32.200 --> 06:38.920
know or if the master itself goes down all of the slaves on that master sends heartbeats to the slaves

06:39.400 --> 06:43.020
slaves send heart beats to the master.

06:43.120 --> 06:48.730
And this allows our closter to detect failures.

06:48.730 --> 06:48.940
Right.

06:48.940 --> 06:56.260
So if we have a slave host that all of a sudden you know goes down it's going to stop sending heartbeats

06:56.290 --> 06:57.580
to the master.

06:57.580 --> 07:03.970
The master can determine that and it will do a couple of tricks to verify that that's actually the case

07:03.970 --> 07:06.360
that the host is truly down.

07:06.450 --> 07:12.120
At which point those victims that are affected can start booting up on other hosts

07:16.660 --> 07:17.150
OK.

07:17.260 --> 07:25.300
So from the perspective of the VM We're certified associate exam what you need to know is that high

07:25.300 --> 07:29.660
availability provides a reliability mechanism right.

07:29.680 --> 07:35.490
If a host fails those VMs are going to restart on other ESX hosts.

07:35.620 --> 07:39.110
But there's going to be some downtime associated with that.

07:39.610 --> 07:46.130
And really the ideal way to configure this is to enable both high availability and DNS on your cluster.

07:46.180 --> 07:48.240
H.A. does not use the motion though.

07:49.390 --> 07:55.420
And we took a little brief look at the architecture how the master sends heartbeats to the slaves.

07:55.480 --> 08:02.650
The slaves send heartbeats to the master and that's how we determine if a host has failed and the component

08:02.650 --> 08:09.120
that actually runs in the host handles all of this heart beating and the communication between hosts.

08:09.160 --> 08:10.620
It's called the fault domain manager.
