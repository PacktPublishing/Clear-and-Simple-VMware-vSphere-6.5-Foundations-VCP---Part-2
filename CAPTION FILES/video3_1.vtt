In this video I'll demonstrate how to verify the network configuration of a virtual machine.

00:08.260 --> 00:15.070
So here I've clicked on my Wii motion demo virtual machine and I want to configure and I'm going to

00:15.100 --> 00:22.360
edit the virtual machine hardware and let's take a look at the virtual network interface card associated

00:22.360 --> 00:24.890
with this VM.

00:24.940 --> 00:32.180
So here we see network adapter one and the first setting that we're concerned with is what virtual machine

00:32.180 --> 00:33.120
port group.

00:33.260 --> 00:39.290
Are you going to connect this VM to have connected it to a port group called 199 and that poor group

00:39.290 --> 00:42.740
has specific villans settings.

00:42.750 --> 00:46.340
It's got security policies associated with it.

00:46.400 --> 00:49.430
It might have things like traffic shaping configured.

00:49.940 --> 00:51.490
So I'll pick the network adapter.

00:51.650 --> 00:56.150
I want to connect the virtual machine to and I'll choose the status right.

00:56.160 --> 00:59.810
Basically is this network adapter plugged in right now or not.

01:00.490 --> 01:03.420
And then I'll choose the adapter type.

01:03.540 --> 01:03.830
Right.

01:03.840 --> 01:12.810
So in this scenario I've chosen and easy one thousand virtual network interface card and the MAC address

01:12.810 --> 01:14.500
is assigned automatically.

01:15.000 --> 01:24.300
Now I might not want to use that e 1000 virtual network interface card as a matter of fact.

01:24.410 --> 01:29.970
There is actually a type of virtual neck that outperforms the 1000.

01:30.070 --> 01:34.310
Now it won't give you a huge performance impact on your virtual machine itself.

01:35.090 --> 01:43.670
But if you use the VM X net three virtual NEC it can actually help the performance of your YES X I host

01:44.060 --> 01:54.760
by using less resources so I can't change this on my existing network adapter but I could come in here

01:55.090 --> 02:04.570
create a new network adapter choose the VM X net three virtual neck type and go ahead and create a second

02:04.570 --> 02:06.610
virtual Nic on this VM.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.820
And that I could potentially move my IP address over to that new virtual Mac after the fact of course

02:13.820 --> 02:17.810
I would be service impacting But that's an option.

02:20.250 --> 02:30.210
I could also choose single route IO virtualization and basically eliminate the virtualization overhead

02:30.300 --> 02:32.040
for this virtual machine.

02:32.040 --> 02:37.260
When it comes to networking this is a very unusual configuration though.

02:37.260 --> 02:45.040
So basically with our VI you're giving this virtual machine dedicated access to a physical Nic.

02:45.150 --> 02:50.810
I don't really want to do that so I'm just going to leave this as is and I'm going to hit OK.

02:50.970 --> 02:56.150
And you can see there I can just go ahead and add additional network interface cards on the fly.

02:56.210 --> 02:57.930
I can do this while the VM is powered on.

02:57.930 --> 02:59.480
I can do it while it's powered off.

03:00.040 --> 03:02.050
Right but right now the VM is powered off.

03:02.050 --> 03:06.250
So my second virtual neck is currently disconnected.

03:07.070 --> 03:10.570
And if I want to get rid of it later on this is a little tricky.

03:10.600 --> 03:17.050
You come in here to the hardware screen and over to the far right you'll see this X where you can actually

03:17.860 --> 03:21.870
remove virtual hardware that will turn red.

03:21.880 --> 03:26.310
Then I go ahead and hit OK and it'll get removed.

03:26.310 --> 03:32.960
So those are the key networking settings for a virtual machine that we're going to configure here.

03:33.220 --> 03:37.140
There's really not a whole lot else that we need to worry about setting up.
