00:00.750 --> 00:06.510
In this video I'll explain the basic concepts of the motion and how it can be used to take a running

00:06.510 --> 00:13.860
virtual machine and move it from one ESX host to another and that's the purpose of the motion.

00:13.890 --> 00:17.170
We have virtual machines that are running on one ESX host.

00:17.220 --> 00:24.990
And maybe we need to do some sort of physical maintenance on that host like add more memory or maybe

00:24.990 --> 00:27.060
we need to load balance.

00:27.060 --> 00:34.410
For example maybe one of our ESX hosts is very heavily utilized and we want to take some running virtual

00:34.410 --> 00:41.280
machines and move them off that heavily utilized host to a host that has less virtual machines on it.

00:41.350 --> 00:48.240
That's what we use the motion for is to take a running VM move it from one physical ESX host to another

00:48.900 --> 00:50.810
with no service outage.

00:51.820 --> 00:55.380
So let's take a look at how Wii motion works.

00:56.290 --> 01:04.900
And in this example we see a virtual machine and purple running on ESX I host one and this is where

01:04.900 --> 01:07.710
the live state of our virtual machine is running.

01:09.050 --> 01:13.460
So maybe we need to take down host one for a memory upgrade.

01:14.000 --> 01:23.100
And we want to move our virtual machine to another host using Wii motion this virtual machine also has

01:23.100 --> 01:29.260
a set of files that we see on the right hand side on our data store.

01:29.370 --> 01:35.900
And so we're going to take this virtual machine and move it to a different ESX host.

01:36.090 --> 01:39.060
It must still be able to access those files.

01:39.060 --> 01:46.590
We cannot have our virtual machine losing access to its files because one of those files is a VM decay

01:47.790 --> 01:50.770
and that VME K is my virtual machines.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.170
C-drive.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.680
Or one of its virtual disks.

01:54.750 --> 02:01.830
So it's imperative that if a VM is going to move from one host to another that it is still able to access

02:02.280 --> 02:06.260
all of its files on the data store.

02:06.470 --> 02:11.320
And so to do that we're going to need what's called shared storage.

02:11.440 --> 02:13.960
And when you hear that term shared storage.

02:14.020 --> 02:15.430
Just think of it this way.

02:16.380 --> 02:23.180
Shared storage is a data store that is accessible across multiple ESX I host it.

02:23.190 --> 02:27.060
So we've got this data store that's available on multiple hosts.

02:27.250 --> 02:32.720
And so if my VM moves from Host 1 to host 2 it's still going to be able to access all of its files.

02:35.200 --> 02:39.650
So here we see my virtual machine has just moved from Host 1 to host 2.

02:39.730 --> 02:45.400
It still has access to its data store because the data store is shared storage and is accessible across

02:45.400 --> 02:46.620
multiple hosts.

02:46.870 --> 02:53.350
And notice on the left hand side the virtual machine is connected to a virtual switch and those virtual

02:53.350 --> 03:00.520
switches are also identically configured so that my VM does not lose access to the network when it moves

03:01.360 --> 03:08.440
the IP address of the virtual machine does not change so that address still needs to provide connectivity

03:09.240 --> 03:12.330
when that VM moves to another host.

03:12.350 --> 03:18.130
OK so let's take a look at an example of what actually happens when we carry out of emotion.

03:18.380 --> 03:26.700
So again my VM is running on host ESX 0 1 and we've configured something called the VM kernel por for

03:26.790 --> 03:27.750
emotion.

03:28.160 --> 03:33.270
The point of a VM kernel port is to handle special traffic.

03:33.350 --> 03:37.550
It's not for Virtu machine traffic it's for other stuff.

03:37.690 --> 03:46.390
So the VM kernel port in this case is marked for Wii motion traffic and what it's going to do is facilitate

03:47.110 --> 03:53.170
a creation of a copy of that virtual machine the destination host.

03:53.230 --> 03:53.840
Right.

03:53.890 --> 03:55.400
So let's rewind here.

03:55.720 --> 04:00.910
My virtual machine is running on ESX I host one right now and it's got stuff running in memory it's

04:00.910 --> 04:03.600
accessing a virtual network interface.

04:03.730 --> 04:05.180
It's accessing storage.

04:05.350 --> 04:09.810
We need to copy the state of that VM to the destination host.

04:09.910 --> 04:13.100
And that's the point of the Wii motion VM kernel port.

04:13.180 --> 04:21.660
And once that copy is complete now I've got an exact duplicate of that VM running on the destination

04:21.660 --> 04:22.690
host.

04:22.740 --> 04:29.190
And so what will happen then is any final changes anything that changed during the Wii motion will also

04:29.190 --> 04:33.330
be copied over and the VM on Host 1 will be halted.

04:34.670 --> 04:37.070
And the VM on Host 2 will take over.

04:37.700 --> 04:42.970
And now we've successfully Wii motion the virtual machine from Host 1 to host 2.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.960
And like I said there's no outage associated with this.

04:45.980 --> 04:54.030
We do need to have the center in place and you may notice a slight bump in latency while this Wii motion

04:54.030 --> 04:54.940
occurs.

04:55.320 --> 04:59.970
But again there's no noticeable outage.

05:00.130 --> 05:05.890
So the motion is used to take a running virtual machine and move it from one host to another.

05:05.890 --> 05:10.780
This is not the only type of motion with these for sex.

05:10.870 --> 05:18.310
We can actually take a virtual machine that's running on a host managed by one V Center instance and

05:18.310 --> 05:20.890
move it to a host managed by another.

05:20.980 --> 05:25.830
The center instance and so prior to these first six this was not possible.

05:25.840 --> 05:34.000
Now we can use crossover center V motion to move a running VM from one host managed by one V Center

05:34.000 --> 05:38.590
server to another host managed by a different the center server.

05:40.620 --> 05:47.010
Another change in these first six is the fact that long distance Wii motion is now supported over connections

05:47.460 --> 05:54.360
with up to 150 milliseconds of latency and we have this ability to take a virtual machine that's running

05:54.660 --> 06:03.990
Wii motion with no service interruption across a long geographic distance as long as that physical connection

06:04.830 --> 06:08.610
does not have more than 150 milliseconds of latency.

06:09.740 --> 06:17.260
We can even migrate virtual machines from one virtual switch to another using cross network Wii motion.

06:17.510 --> 06:22.880
And so in this lesson we learned how Wii motion can be used to take a running VM move it from one host

06:22.880 --> 06:29.410
to another and how we need a Wii motion VM kernel port in order to copy the required information.

06:30.400 --> 06:37.840
These first six introduced a number of new Wii motion features like cross the center of the motion cross

06:37.860 --> 06:45.340
a virtual switch Wii motion and long distance Wii motion with networks up to 150 milliseconds of latency.
