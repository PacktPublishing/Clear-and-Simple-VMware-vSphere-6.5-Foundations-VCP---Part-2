In this video I'll explain the fear of fault tolerance of fault tolerance can be used to provide 100

00:07.590 --> 00:14.670
percent uptime for critical virtual machines and fault tolerance has undergone some significant changes

00:14.670 --> 00:22.770
in vees fair six in that it actually protects virtual machine data so we can have no data loss no transaction

00:22.770 --> 00:31.140
loss or TCAP connection loss the primary virtue machine is protected by mirroring it to a secondary

00:31.140 --> 00:38.340
virtual machine that's running on another ESX host and the secondary VM is kept exactly the same as

00:38.340 --> 00:44.730
the primary so that we can easily fail over to the secondary with no downtime

00:47.210 --> 00:54.830
if the primary virtue machine fails the secondary takes over and becomes the primary and then a new

00:54.830 --> 01:01.500
secondary VM is spawned on a different host to protect that new primary VM.

01:03.220 --> 01:09.990
A second day early data store can also be selected to store their files for the secondary VM protecting

01:09.990 --> 01:15.620
our virtual machine from data loss should the primary virtue machines data store fail.

01:17.700 --> 01:23.550
Fault tolerance supports up to two virtual C.P. with VSE for standard and up to four virtual Sipah use

01:23.550 --> 01:24.500
on Enterprise.

01:24.510 --> 01:32.010
Plus it supports VM ocean on the primary and secondary VM and it supports thin provisioned or thick

01:32.010 --> 01:33.570
provisioned virtual disks.

01:33.570 --> 01:39.240
This is another change since vse fair 5.5 Envy's for sex.

01:39.240 --> 01:47.560
We have all these different disk types supported and we have multiday VCP to support it requires high

01:47.560 --> 01:53.610
availability and enhanced emotion compatibility to be configured on the cluster.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.570
So let's take a look at how fault tolerance works.

01:57.570 --> 02:02.090
We have a primary virtue machine and a secondary virtual machine.

02:02.090 --> 02:08.280
And in order to get this running we need to create a fault tolerant logging network to keep the primary

02:08.280 --> 02:11.400
VM and the secondary VM identical.

02:11.400 --> 02:19.280
We'll do this by configuring a VM kernel port and configuring it for fault tolerance logging traffic.

02:19.430 --> 02:27.440
Then I will enable fault tolerance on a primary virtual machine which will result in the secondary VM

02:27.440 --> 02:28.670
being created.

02:31.180 --> 02:37.870
You can also choose a data store when you configure fault tolerance to keep a copy of the virtual machine

02:37.870 --> 02:42.700
files on some other data store for that secondary VM.

02:43.000 --> 02:50.640
So now we have a primary and a secondary VM and also a copy of those virtual machine files on two different

02:50.690 --> 02:55.230
datasource and asked changes happened on the primary VM.

02:55.280 --> 03:01.680
They were immediately copied into memory on the secondary virtual machine so that those virtual machines

03:01.680 --> 03:09.840
are kept in the exact identical state and this is very helpful when we have a failure like an ESX host

03:09.840 --> 03:11.940
failure for example.

03:11.960 --> 03:21.440
So here ESX 0 1 is failed and there is an instantaneous immediate fail over to the secondary via Now

03:21.440 --> 03:29.050
the secondary VM is going to become the primary virtual machine and a new secondary will be created

03:29.050 --> 03:33.660
on one of the other surviving hosts to report Takht this virtual machine.

03:36.930 --> 03:41.990
Now one thing that this doesn't protect you from is a guest operating system problem.

03:42.970 --> 03:49.700
So let's say within the primary virtual machine we get the Windows Blue Screen of Death while the contents

03:49.700 --> 03:56.540
of memory on that primary VM are going to be immediately copy did the secondary via So the Windows Blue

03:56.540 --> 03:58.630
Screen of Death will appear there as well.

03:58.770 --> 04:02.930
All right so there are certain types of failures that fall tolerance doesn't really protect you from.
