In this video we'll talk about troubleshooting common installation issues with ESX and V Center OK.

00:10.940 --> 00:17.210
So when we're installing ESX high we have a few different options of ways that we can actually perform

00:17.210 --> 00:18.390
the installation.

00:18.770 --> 00:20.760
We can do an interactive installation.

00:20.930 --> 00:28.940
This is probably the most common way that people install ESX I for the first time right where basically

00:28.940 --> 00:37.400
you have the ESX site installation media you boot up a host from let's say a DVD and you go through

00:37.400 --> 00:40.930
all the prompts and you manually install ESX.

00:41.210 --> 00:46.500
That's definitely the most common option if you're having problems there.

00:46.580 --> 00:50.650
Make sure that you've got the boot order in your bios selected correctly.

00:50.690 --> 00:57.310
Right so that the ESX host will actually boot from the media you're using to install ESX side.

00:57.410 --> 00:59.270
That's a pretty straightforward one.

01:00.940 --> 01:10.570
You can also install ESX from us be devices you can install ESX by using a scripted installation where

01:10.570 --> 01:19.270
you write your own script to control the installation of ESX from some sort of image repository or you

01:19.270 --> 01:21.160
can use auto deploy.

01:21.340 --> 01:27.250
Now I wouldn't expect to see a lot on the VSE for six foundations exam about these topics but if you're

01:27.250 --> 01:33.820
taking the VCP exam you can expect some questions about scripted installations and auto deploy.

01:34.920 --> 01:43.830
From the perspective of auto deploy what you're actually doing is you're booting up ESX hosts with no

01:43.920 --> 01:46.140
local image whatsoever.

01:46.560 --> 01:51.030
They might not even have any local storage whatsoever.

01:51.800 --> 01:58.370
And as you're ESX I host boot up they're doing something called a Pixi boot and the Pixi bu enables

01:58.370 --> 02:06.260
them to boot from an average on a TFT server which allows them to then download and ESX site image directly

02:06.260 --> 02:07.120
into memory.

02:07.940 --> 02:14.000
So you can actually write it ESX I hosts with no local storage whatsoever.

02:14.210 --> 02:20.150
And so without getting into a whole bunch of detail on auto ploy just understand that we've got all

02:20.150 --> 02:23.130
these different ways to install ESX II.

02:23.690 --> 02:29.390
Here we're primarily focused on the interactive installation method.

02:29.470 --> 02:29.750
Right.

02:29.780 --> 02:35.720
So we'll talk a little bit about some of the troubleshooting you can do with the interactive installation.

02:35.990 --> 02:40.970
But first let's talk about the impact of improper licensing.

02:41.390 --> 02:41.810
Right.

02:42.110 --> 02:50.440
So if you have an expired visa center license what you'll see in your visa for a web client is all of

02:50.440 --> 02:53.890
your hosts will appear to be disconnected.

02:54.500 --> 03:00.210
That's usually the result of an expired visa have a license and you cannot connect your hosts to the

03:00.210 --> 03:09.470
sender until that license is either replaced or something along those lines you have to have a current

03:09.470 --> 03:12.680
valid license to connect those hosts.

03:12.920 --> 03:20.300
You also can't apply a license to a host if the license has insufficient C.P. use.

03:20.310 --> 03:27.230
Right so if you have a license for ACP use and you have a host with 16 C.P use while you're not going

03:27.230 --> 03:31.300
to be able to apply that license to that host.

03:31.530 --> 03:36.200
Now and this screen we're actually looking at V.M. Where is documentation.

03:36.310 --> 03:42.640
And here you can see a document called collecting logs for troubleshooting a V Center server installation

03:42.670 --> 03:44.310
or upgrade.

03:44.380 --> 03:49.230
This is important information for the certification and for real life as well.

03:49.570 --> 03:57.160
So if you're installing or upgrading vse center there is a number of logs that are specific only to

03:57.160 --> 03:58.690
the installation process.

03:58.690 --> 04:04.630
Right so if an installation or upgrade fails you can check these logs to help you identify the source

04:04.630 --> 04:05.980
of the failure.

04:06.610 --> 04:13.250
And the most common method is to simply use the installation wizard to collect those installation logs.

04:13.250 --> 04:13.720
Right.

04:14.080 --> 04:20.790
So if the installation fails and we get this page thing the set up has been interrupted and there some

04:20.880 --> 04:27.880
checkboxes automatically selected that will simply allow you to download those log files.

04:28.120 --> 04:34.210
So that's the easiest and simplest way but there's also other options you can collect deployment log

04:34.210 --> 04:36.400
files from the center server appliance.

04:36.400 --> 04:43.270
You can even export a V Center server support bundle for troubleshooting.

04:43.750 --> 04:50.290
And so this the documentation will walk you through you know all of the individual steps required to

04:50.320 --> 04:51.890
complete these tasks.

04:52.210 --> 04:57.380
And while we're in the documentation there is one other document I want to show you.

04:57.910 --> 05:03.150
This is another error that I would not be shocked to see on the certification test.

05:03.580 --> 05:11.380
If you get this error Microsoft sequel database set to unsupported compatibility mode causes the center

05:11.380 --> 05:13.880
installation to fail.

05:14.020 --> 05:18.040
Basically at this point you just have to make sure you're running a database version that's actually

05:18.040 --> 05:19.470
supported by the center.

05:19.760 --> 05:28.890
So if sequel 2008 is set up to run in sequel 2000 compatibility mode this error occurs.

05:28.930 --> 05:33.730
This is the type of scenario you want to memorize for the certification test.
