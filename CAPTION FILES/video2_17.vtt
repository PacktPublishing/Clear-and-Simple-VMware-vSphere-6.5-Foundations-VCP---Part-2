In this video I'll explain the different automation levels that can be enabled on a distributed resource

00:05.490 --> 00:08.430
scheduler cluster.

00:08.470 --> 00:14.800
The first automation level is called manual mode and manual mode is often the first step taken when

00:14.800 --> 00:22.950
you create a IRS cluster manual mode is going to provide you with recommendations but it's not going

00:22.950 --> 00:25.570
to take any automated actions.

00:25.590 --> 00:29.020
It won't Wii motion virtual machines without asking you.

00:29.250 --> 00:33.970
It won't place virtual machines on host says a power on automatically.

00:34.140 --> 00:41.000
It will simply provide you with a list of recommendations that you can choose to manually carry out.

00:42.280 --> 00:48.070
When virtual machines are powered on it will also provide you with what's called an initial placement

00:48.160 --> 00:49.780
recommendation.

00:50.540 --> 00:57.160
The initial placement is a recommendation that tells you here is the ideal host to run this virtual

00:57.160 --> 00:59.330
machine on as it's powered on.

01:01.380 --> 01:06.860
So that's manual mode and that's a great way to get a feel for what D.R. S is going to do.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.180
What is de-risk going to recommend.

01:09.180 --> 01:11.880
And you can try that before fully automated Garrus

01:14.480 --> 01:16.670
and partially automated mode.

01:16.690 --> 01:21.150
We're actually going to start to let dealers make some decisions for us.

01:21.250 --> 01:28.300
It's going to primarily operate the same way as manual mode in that it will not automatically Wii motion

01:28.840 --> 01:30.840
any running virtual machines.

01:32.590 --> 01:39.670
However on initial placement when you power on a virtual machine DNS is going to automatically select

01:39.670 --> 01:42.580
the ideal host and power up the virtual machine there.

01:45.880 --> 01:53.500
Finally fully automated mode work completely allowing DRM to take over virtual machines can be moved

01:53.500 --> 02:01.410
from host to host using the motion automatically and without any input from the administrator.

02:01.420 --> 02:04.970
Now the administrator can adjust the level of sensitivity.

02:05.260 --> 02:10.910
So how frequently do we want these virtual machines to move most of the time.

02:10.950 --> 02:16.770
You should leave it at the default setting but if you want virtual machines to only move in the most

02:16.770 --> 02:20.710
dire circumstances you can adjust that sensitivity down.

02:23.830 --> 02:30.910
When virtual machines are powered on initial placement occurs automatically they're automatically placed

02:30.910 --> 02:32.080
on the ideal host.
