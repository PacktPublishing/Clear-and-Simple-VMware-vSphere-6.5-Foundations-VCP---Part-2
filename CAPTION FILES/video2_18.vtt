In this video I'll explain Diodorus and resource fragmentation and how Deros can help in a high availability

00:08.210 --> 00:08.760
event.

00:09.670 --> 00:17.890
In the slide you see here we have a four host cluster of ESX 0 1 0 2 0 3 and 0 4.

00:17.890 --> 00:26.330
And if you'll notice on host ESX size 0 4 I've got a really large virtual machine running now with a

00:26.330 --> 00:28.230
high availability event.

00:28.280 --> 00:31.210
We're potentially losing in ESX host.

00:31.280 --> 00:39.020
So let's say in this scenario we lose host ESX size zero for that host is now failed and they have this

00:39.020 --> 00:47.850
really large virtual machine that isn't going to fit comfortably on any of the surviving ESX I hosts.

00:47.850 --> 00:53.820
Maybe I even have a reservation that will prevent it from booting on any of these other hosts.

00:53.850 --> 00:56.750
This is called Resource fragmentation.

00:56.820 --> 01:01.790
The remaining hosts have plenty of capacity to run this virtual machine.

01:01.840 --> 01:10.800
However those resources are spread out in small chunks over a group of hosts so no single host has the

01:10.800 --> 01:13.730
resources necessary to run this VM.

01:14.680 --> 01:17.280
This is where DRM can help us.

01:17.530 --> 01:24.030
If an ESX I host fails HLA is going to try to reboot those virtual machines on other hosts.

01:24.250 --> 01:33.400
DRM us can move around virtual machines to consolidate the workloads on other hosts and make room for

01:33.400 --> 01:35.640
this really large VM.

01:35.730 --> 01:40.320
So I always say that HHN DNS are sort of like peanut butter and jelly.

01:40.380 --> 01:43.960
They go good separately but they're best when they're put together.

01:44.220 --> 01:46.180
And this is an example of that.

01:46.470 --> 01:51.550
Ha won't perform as well if DRM is not enabled on this cluster as well.
