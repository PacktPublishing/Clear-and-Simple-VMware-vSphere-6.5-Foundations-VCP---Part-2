00:00.480 --> 00:04.860
In this video I'll explain high availability admission control.

00:05.020 --> 00:12.360
Now the purpose of admission control is to ensure that these fair high availability has enough spare

00:12.360 --> 00:19.110
resources to accommodate the failure of one or more ESX hosts.

00:19.260 --> 00:25.470
And when we have a host failure with ha all of the teams that were running on that host will fail and

00:25.470 --> 00:28.620
they'll get booted up on other hosts within that cluster.

00:29.830 --> 00:37.210
So as these VMT that are failed get restarted on these other hosts we're going to use that mission control

00:37.210 --> 00:44.260
to ensure that those hosts that still remain have enough spare resources to adequately run those virtual

00:44.260 --> 00:45.070
machines.

00:46.100 --> 00:50.560
And also make sure that virtual machines with reservations will be able to boot.

00:51.660 --> 00:58.530
Now if a virtual machine has a reservation that means that that VM is guaranteed a certain amount of

00:58.530 --> 01:05.030
resources and if those resources are not available the VM won't be able to boot.

01:05.040 --> 01:10.980
So again high availability of mission control is going to help us ensure that if an ha event occurs

01:11.190 --> 01:16.090
every single virtual machine ends up booting up.

01:16.170 --> 01:22.770
So here we see a cluster of ESX I hosts and on each of these ESX I hosts we're utilizing about 80 percent

01:22.770 --> 01:24.540
of the memory or c.p.

01:24.810 --> 01:25.350
Right.

01:25.740 --> 01:33.810
And if one of these hosts now fails there is not enough spare capacity on the surviving hosts to adequately

01:33.810 --> 01:36.230
run those virtual machines.

01:36.690 --> 01:44.280
Therefore we need something like a Mission Control to kind of place some limits on these hosts and ensure

01:44.280 --> 01:50.270
that we don't run so many Reems that we can't tolerate a failure.

01:50.280 --> 01:57.300
Now if an ESX I host fails we have enough spare capacity to boot those virtual machines up the surviving

01:57.300 --> 01:59.780
hosts.

01:59.910 --> 02:05.490
So here we see the first admission control policy that we can choose from which is called Host failures

02:05.490 --> 02:07.720
that clustered Howard's.

02:07.970 --> 02:13.640
This is a very common choice but it's not as simple as it sounds and it's often misunderstood.

02:14.000 --> 02:16.980
So let's take a look at how this method works.

02:17.000 --> 02:24.290
The first step is to calculate the slot size which is based on the largest CPU and memory reservations

02:24.650 --> 02:28.990
of any virtual machine in the cluster.

02:29.000 --> 02:37.370
So here we see VM one with a 1 gig memory reservation and VM 2 with a 500 megahertz CPQ reservation.

02:37.370 --> 02:42.530
And those two virtual machines combine to form our slot size.

02:42.530 --> 02:47.470
So now we know how big the biggest VM can possibly be.

02:47.900 --> 02:54.650
And the next step is to determine how many slots can run on each of our hosts.

02:54.700 --> 03:01.990
So all of our hosts in this case support the same number of slots and let's assume that high availability

03:01.990 --> 03:05.980
is configured to tolerate a single host failure.

03:05.980 --> 03:12.480
That means we need to set aside five slots as spare capacity.

03:12.520 --> 03:15.300
Now let's say that we have a large virtual machine.

03:15.310 --> 03:23.760
See on the left VM one now has a 4 gig memory reservation Well that's going to contribute to a larger

03:23.760 --> 03:26.060
slot size.

03:26.280 --> 03:30.840
And that's going to skew the number of slots that are available per host.

03:30.840 --> 03:34.350
Right now I can only power on two virtual machines per host.

03:34.530 --> 03:40.520
And let's not forget we need to set aside one Holst's worth of resources for failover.

03:40.560 --> 03:48.620
So now my cluster has the same hardware but because my slot size is larger I can run less virtual machines.

03:50.440 --> 03:52.210
So in this slide here.

03:52.210 --> 03:57.550
Notice we now have four usable slots.

03:57.610 --> 04:04.330
Let's say that because we can't power on many VA EMS we decide hey let's take host ESX zero or three

04:04.690 --> 04:12.610
and double the memory and double the C.P you so now host ESX zero or three has way more resources than

04:12.610 --> 04:13.710
it had before.

04:14.490 --> 04:21.120
And we still have the 4 gig memory reservation on VM one on the left and 500 to make her reservation

04:21.350 --> 04:23.260
in the VM two on the right.

04:23.520 --> 04:32.980
So our slot size remains unchanged but now our cluster as a whole can run a total of eight slots.

04:33.050 --> 04:38.110
So we're hoping hey we're going to have more than four usable slots this time around.

04:38.390 --> 04:38.870
Well no.

04:38.900 --> 04:47.240
No such luck because we need to account for a failure of the largest host their force for slots have

04:47.240 --> 04:53.810
to be reserved for fail over and we end up again with four usable slots just like we had before the

04:53.810 --> 04:56.290
memory in the upgrade.

04:56.400 --> 04:58.970
So this method can be a little tricky.

04:59.350 --> 05:04.420
And when people can't boot up their virtual machines they tend to turn off at Mission Control which

05:04.420 --> 05:05.340
is a bad thing.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.070
So there's a few things you can do.

05:08.070 --> 05:16.830
Number one you can manually configure the slot size or you could simply configure a percentage of resources

05:17.430 --> 05:21.710
that admission control reserves no tricky slot sizes here.

05:21.780 --> 05:28.320
It's just a simple percentage that says hey we're going to reserve 25 percent of resources for failover

05:28.770 --> 05:34.270
while not all of these hosts you know 36 gigs out of 48 will be usable.

05:34.300 --> 05:37.230
This is a really simple way to do this.

05:37.270 --> 05:42.520
And if we say hey let's take that fourth host and give it more resources.

05:43.200 --> 05:43.370
Right.

05:43.390 --> 05:49.130
Double the memory one that we're going to actually get something of doubling the memory of that host.

05:49.210 --> 05:54.040
We're going to get double the amount of usable memory because we're using a simple percentage.

05:54.070 --> 05:59.740
And this also helps just reduce the odds that somebody is going to just turn off at mission control

05:59.740 --> 06:05.450
because they can boot up a VM.

06:05.520 --> 06:11.850
The final admission control method you can utilize is by specifying a fail over host.

06:11.850 --> 06:17.810
This is like setting aside one host just for failover no Reems run on this host.

06:17.910 --> 06:20.040
It's simply spare capacity.
