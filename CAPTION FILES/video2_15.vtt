In this video I'll describe the relationship of the center and distributed resource scheduler.

00:08.330 --> 00:13.700
So first off we have to have the center in order to create a dress cluster.

00:13.700 --> 00:20.960
We can't create any type of host cluster without the center so we need the Center for that management

00:20.990 --> 00:26.520
capability of creating an ESX I host cluster.

00:26.550 --> 00:32.800
Now once we've created that de-risk cluster the center stays involved.

00:32.850 --> 00:37.090
This isn't like high availability with high availability.

00:37.090 --> 00:42.480
The center is used to create the cluster and then the center kind of steps aside and H.A. can run with

00:42.480 --> 00:43.980
it without the center.

00:44.190 --> 00:50.650
Diyar Ross cannot run without the center because we can't even carry out of the motion without the center.

00:50.790 --> 00:53.030
And that's what difference does.

00:53.150 --> 01:04.020
It uses VM motion to load balance by distributing virtual machines across hosts evenly so yes absolutely

01:04.020 --> 01:05.430
requires the center.

01:05.430 --> 01:10.110
We need the center to configure and we need the Center for DRM to operate.
