00:01.580 --> 00:09.170
In this video I'll demonstrate how to set up a cluster of VSX I hosts for high availability.

00:09.280 --> 00:15.820
So here you can see we've already created a cluster and it contains two ESX I hosts and one running

00:15.820 --> 00:17.980
virtual machine.

00:18.050 --> 00:25.510
So I'm going to start by clicking on my cluster and choosing configure in under configure.

00:25.570 --> 00:32.980
I can go to the VST fear availability option and at the moment availability is turned off and proactive

00:32.980 --> 00:35.210
ha is turned off.

00:35.360 --> 00:43.720
OK so let's go ahead and click on at it and we can start to configure some of our high availability

00:43.720 --> 00:44.590
settings here.

00:44.950 --> 00:49.800
So we're going to start by simply turning on VSE for high availability.

00:50.040 --> 00:58.010
And you can see here there are some definitions right as far as what we want ha to do and when.

00:58.050 --> 01:06.640
So at the moment it's configured to simply restart any Reems that are on a host if that host fails.

01:06.660 --> 01:06.830
Right.

01:06.840 --> 01:09.190
That's what H.A. is going to do for us.

01:09.240 --> 01:16.380
It's not going to give us 100 percent uptime it's not constant uptime solution but if a host does fail

01:16.590 --> 01:22.150
those VMs will reboot on other ESX host.

01:22.230 --> 01:30.660
We can also do things like have our VMS boot up on a different host if there is a host isolation event.

01:30.670 --> 01:38.760
All right so if an ESX host loses the ability to communicate with the other hosts over the heartbeat

01:38.770 --> 01:42.510
network that host is considered to be isolated.

01:43.240 --> 01:45.900
So we can choose what action we want to take there.

01:46.240 --> 01:51.940
If there are storage conditions that occur like a permanent device loss or in all paths down condition

01:52.570 --> 02:00.910
we can also reboot those VMs on other hosts or if the guest operating system itself fails we can reboot

02:00.910 --> 02:03.600
that virtual machine right on the same host.

02:03.610 --> 02:08.190
These are all actions that VSE for high availability can take.

02:08.530 --> 02:13.820
So let's take a look and choose some of our configurations here.

02:14.690 --> 02:26.360
Now in my scenario for my host failure response if my ESX host fails I want those VMs to restart and

02:26.360 --> 02:30.480
by default all VMS are going to have the same priority.

02:30.500 --> 02:35.500
So all of my VMS will have a medium priority by default right.

02:35.540 --> 02:44.040
I'll show you in a little while how to override some of those settings on individual Vienna's.

02:44.290 --> 02:48.600
I can also create virtual machine dependencies right.

02:48.610 --> 02:52.960
So if I want to create some virtual machine dependencies I can do that as well.

02:53.020 --> 02:53.560
Right.

02:53.950 --> 03:01.510
And I can set conditions that all have to be met in order for virtual machines to boot up my host isolation

03:01.510 --> 03:02.640
response.

03:02.680 --> 03:12.250
In this scenario I'm going to assume that if my management network is down my VMs are probably nonfunctional

03:12.250 --> 03:12.910
as well.

03:13.070 --> 03:17.680
It may be the management network shares hardware with a storage network or something like that.

03:18.100 --> 03:24.850
So I'm going to go ahead and say you know what if we have a management network failure and I know heartbeats

03:24.850 --> 03:25.990
don't work anymore.

03:26.080 --> 03:28.860
Go ahead and shut down those VMs boot them up on another host.

03:28.870 --> 03:29.770
So I'm going to enable that

03:32.600 --> 03:33.950
permanent device loss.

03:33.980 --> 03:35.410
I'll enable that as well.

03:35.510 --> 03:37.340
And all paths down condition.

03:37.340 --> 03:45.230
So if there is just some sort of storage failure like for example a permanent device loss is a scenario

03:45.230 --> 03:52.700
where your storage array is going down and it sends a sends code to tell the ESX host Hey I am failing

03:52.730 --> 03:54.740
I'm not coming back.

03:55.460 --> 03:57.330
That's a permanent device loss condition.

03:57.350 --> 04:05.190
And in that case we might as well power off and restart those VMC.

04:05.190 --> 04:06.140
Now let's take a look at it.

04:06.150 --> 04:08.160
Mission control.

04:08.160 --> 04:08.490
All right.

04:08.510 --> 04:19.190
So at Mission Control has changed significantly in Envy's fair 6.5 in older versions we had to worry

04:19.190 --> 04:26.250
about things like slot size right by default.

04:26.250 --> 04:35.250
That's the way that our A ha coster's used to be configured as with the slot policy and that led to

04:35.250 --> 04:39.560
a lot of little problems like sometimes you weren't able to power on VM.

04:39.570 --> 04:44.140
Or sometimes you had significant resource wastage.

04:44.220 --> 04:53.040
So in ESX 6.5 one of the great things that they've changed is that's no longer the scenario.

04:53.220 --> 04:53.580
Right.

04:53.670 --> 05:01.590
So what it will do is if you configure the default settings the center will determine OK we need to

05:01.650 --> 05:05.970
protect against one host failure or to host failure or three host failures.

05:05.970 --> 05:06.770
Right.

05:06.930 --> 05:14.190
You choose how many hosts that you want to basically prepare for the loss of it.

05:14.230 --> 05:21.090
So if I have a hundred hosts I might need to accommodate three or four host failure simultaneously.

05:21.270 --> 05:26.750
But in my environment I only have two hosts so I'm only going to tolerate one host failure.

05:28.250 --> 05:35.270
So where this is going to do is it's essentially going to say OK if the biggest host fails what percentage

05:35.270 --> 05:44.050
of our resources do we lose and then it'll basically reserve that capacity so that in case a host does

05:44.050 --> 05:51.610
fail things will still continue to operate normally with no performance degradation.

05:51.610 --> 05:58.420
Now what if I say you know what I'm OK with a certain level of performance degradation you know maybe

05:58.420 --> 06:05.440
if I lose one of my two hosts maybe I'm willing to let everything run with only 75 percent of the normal

06:05.440 --> 06:06.660
speed.

06:06.820 --> 06:11.130
Maybe some of my Wii may not perform quite as well.

06:11.320 --> 06:12.650
I can live with that.

06:13.000 --> 06:19.750
So I'm going to go ahead and get that 75 and then I'm going to do some other things to minimize the

06:19.750 --> 06:22.340
impact of that resource shortage.

06:22.390 --> 06:24.280
Show you those things a little bit later.

06:26.110 --> 06:28.350
There we've got our heartbeat data stores.

06:28.380 --> 06:32.210
This is kind of a backup method for my host to heart beat.

06:32.460 --> 06:37.410
So that way if the management network goes down the hosts can accurately determine the status of the

06:37.410 --> 06:38.280
other hosts.

06:39.300 --> 06:40.650
And that's really it for now.

06:40.650 --> 06:49.540
All right I'm going to go ahead and hit OK here and I have now enabled high availability on my Questor.

06:49.650 --> 06:59.790
I am now going to simulate and ESX I host failure by powering off this ESX host without putting in maintenance

06:59.790 --> 07:00.740
mode.

07:01.240 --> 07:02.740
So all right click the host.

07:02.760 --> 07:04.320
I'm going to do shut down.

07:04.390 --> 07:11.760
It'll warn me that it's not in maintenance mode and so my Wii motion demo virtual machine is going to

07:11.760 --> 07:13.820
fail at this point.

07:14.270 --> 07:18.760
And my Wii motion demo VM is going to fail when that host shuts down.

07:18.760 --> 07:25.380
And let's go ahead and monitor this virtual machine and let's see what's going on with it as the ESX

07:25.380 --> 07:26.980
I hope it fails.

07:27.270 --> 07:29.000
So the ESX host has failed.

07:29.040 --> 07:31.100
Now my virtual machine is disconnected.

07:31.180 --> 07:31.830
Right.

07:31.890 --> 07:37.460
We can see here the virtual machine is disconnected that's the first bad thing that happened right.

07:38.700 --> 07:40.120
Right now the VM is disconnected.

07:40.170 --> 07:42.310
We'll keep an eye on this for a minute here.

07:42.510 --> 07:51.690
It's not going to take very long for that virtual machine to start rebooting on a different ESX host.

07:51.700 --> 07:58.780
OK so I paused my recording for a little while and just to kind of speed things up a little bit.

07:58.780 --> 08:06.540
For those of you watching and here you can see eventually ha restarted the virtual machine.

08:06.610 --> 08:15.010
And so now we can see here on our second ESX host that this virtual machine running on the other host

08:15.020 --> 08:20.070
which is exactly what we would expect to see with high availability.

08:20.560 --> 08:25.630
So we have now configured ha on our ESX host cluster.

08:25.630 --> 08:31.090
Now one final thing I just want to point out before we move on here let's take a look at the configuration

08:31.090 --> 08:33.290
of this V.M..

08:33.440 --> 08:37.930
There are some critical things that we need to make sure are configured properly.

08:37.970 --> 08:38.210
All right.

08:38.210 --> 08:43.050
Number one our virtual machine needs to be on shared storage.

08:43.160 --> 08:45.700
And so we've got that here now is good.

08:45.860 --> 08:53.040
The network adapter needs to be connected to a network that is present on both of the ESX host.

08:53.070 --> 08:53.680
Right.

08:53.750 --> 08:59.750
So those are some of the things that add a virtual machine level could potentially create some problems

08:59.750 --> 09:00.380
with ha.
