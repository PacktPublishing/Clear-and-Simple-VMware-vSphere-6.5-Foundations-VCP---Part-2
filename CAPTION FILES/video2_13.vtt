00:00.400 --> 00:07.370
In this video I'll introduce you to the VSE for distributed resource scheduler or Diyar Wrath's feature

00:08.910 --> 00:12.500
and de-stress is a really a fairly simple feature.

00:12.510 --> 00:18.960
Now it takes some work to properly implement it but essentially what Deros provides us with is Wii motion

00:18.960 --> 00:22.240
for load balancing purposes.

00:22.270 --> 00:27.690
So for example let's say that we have the two ESX I hosts shown in the slide.

00:27.910 --> 00:30.960
And in reality we would probably have more host than this.

00:31.180 --> 00:39.520
But essentially what the press is going to do is this if ESX I host one starts to become overwhelmed.

00:39.640 --> 00:46.540
We can use Wii motion to load balance and we can take this virtual machine and we can migrate it to

00:46.540 --> 00:49.030
a different host with no downtime.

00:49.030 --> 00:54.670
Right that's one of the main purposes of the motion is to allow us to load balance across.

00:54.740 --> 01:02.220
ESX hosts but identifying when these emotions need to happen.

01:02.220 --> 01:10.220
You know identifying when is an imbalance across multiple ESX hosts becomes increasingly difficult as

01:10.220 --> 01:13.120
your environment gets larger and larger.

01:13.140 --> 01:15.450
That's where Diyar RASC comes in.

01:15.590 --> 01:23.520
The press will automatically Wii motion virtual machines from host to host for the purposes of load

01:23.520 --> 01:30.260
balancing and Wii motion is really the bedrock of dress.

01:30.290 --> 01:34.570
So we have to make sure that our venoms are Wii motion compatible.

01:34.670 --> 01:42.410
So things like a local ISO images things like mismatched processors things like insufficient bandwidth

01:42.410 --> 01:49.760
that our connection can all impose some limitations or compatibility issues when it comes to Wii motion.

01:50.270 --> 01:56.780
And you'll notice here at the bottom of your screen it says CVM or knowledge base article 1 0 0 3 6

01:56.780 --> 02:03.530
8 4 for common Wii motion areas that will walk you through a lot of the kind of the motion and compatibility

02:03.530 --> 02:07.220
issues that you could potentially run into.

02:07.220 --> 02:10.490
Now it's not really covered on the VM or certified associate exam.

02:10.490 --> 02:12.490
So I don't spend a lot of time on it here.

02:13.930 --> 02:22.330
But check out that knowledge base article or Also check out w w w dot trayner Testim com slash you to

02:22.330 --> 02:27.160
me for information on where you can get additional resources

02:31.650 --> 02:33.770
Deros comes in a few different flavors.

02:33.780 --> 02:37.400
We've got manual mode right end with theorist's manual mode.

02:37.440 --> 02:45.120
What you're looking to do is enable DRM so that it can load balance across a cluster but maybe you're

02:45.120 --> 02:50.560
not entirely comfortable with allowing it to happen automatically.

02:50.610 --> 02:55.570
Maybe you don't want virtual machines being Wii motion all over your cluster in the middle of the day.

02:56.460 --> 03:01.050
Or maybe you're just not comfortable with the RSA enough to allow it to take over this point.

03:01.050 --> 03:07.410
But in the future you might go with fully automated mode manual mode is a good starting point because

03:07.410 --> 03:11.220
manual mode does not do any thing automatically.

03:11.220 --> 03:18.240
What it does is it analyzes the performance of your cluster and it gives you recommendations and you

03:18.240 --> 03:22.480
can choose whether or not you want to carry out those recommendations.

03:24.680 --> 03:31.380
In partially automated mode this is all a little bit more automation than you get with manual mode.

03:31.380 --> 03:38.800
Basically what it means is when you power on a virtual machine for the first time it's automatically

03:38.800 --> 03:40.530
placed on the ideal host.

03:40.870 --> 03:47.160
So dear rest we'll do a little bit of automation here basically just saying hey somebody just powered

03:47.160 --> 03:48.730
on a new VM.

03:48.730 --> 03:50.810
You don't have to pick which host to power it on.

03:51.610 --> 03:58.110
Deros will automatically select the ideal host for you right now with fully automated mode.

03:58.120 --> 04:00.800
This is like putting it on autopilot.

04:00.940 --> 04:09.120
You're telling your cluster OK V Center is going to monitor this cluster and if a performance improvement

04:09.150 --> 04:18.740
can be made by migrating a VM then the rest will automatically use the motion to migrate that VM to

04:18.740 --> 04:20.030
the ideal host.

04:20.980 --> 04:27.470
And so and with fully automated mode we are turning over control to dress and saying load balance costs

04:27.480 --> 04:28.950
are automatically for us.

04:29.020 --> 04:33.520
You know there's no there's no manual approval of these changes.

04:33.580 --> 04:36.360
They just happen.

04:36.510 --> 04:39.600
So you can choose any one of those three different automation levels.

04:39.750 --> 04:48.790
You can also specify certain affinity or anti affinity rules like for example when I enable digraphs

04:48.840 --> 04:55.250
on a cluster I have to think about which virtual machines should be separated.

04:55.360 --> 05:03.180
And so for example here we see two domain controller virtual machines or domain controller run as running

05:03.180 --> 05:09.200
on ESX 0 3 domain controller 2 is running on ESX 0 4.

05:09.420 --> 05:16.650
But Diyar US has the keys now and it can move virtual machines wherever it sees fit.

05:17.100 --> 05:24.780
And so if I just allow DNS to do whatever it wants it might potentially take domain controller one domain

05:24.780 --> 05:29.840
controller two and put them on the same host for load balancing reasons.

05:30.150 --> 05:36.010
And if that host were to fail I now have lost both of my domain controllers.

05:37.240 --> 05:39.340
Now they may boot up on other hosts.

05:40.720 --> 05:46.380
But for at least a little while my environment has no running domain controllers.

05:46.730 --> 05:54.890
Well now with an anti affinity rule what the anti affinity rule will do is basically tell the IRS these

05:54.890 --> 05:58.220
VMS need to run on different hosts.

05:58.410 --> 06:03.990
And so that way de-risk will never automatically migrate these two VMS the same host.

06:03.990 --> 06:08.100
It'll keep them separated for redundancy purposes.

06:08.100 --> 06:15.670
And those are virtual machine affinity or anti affinity rules affinity rules keep VMS together.

06:16.070 --> 06:18.280
Anti-fan the rules keep them apart.

06:23.500 --> 06:26.250
So how does Wii center fit into this picture.

06:26.350 --> 06:34.050
Well we'll use Wii Center with the Vee's for a web client to create a cluster and to enable de-stress

06:34.060 --> 06:35.020
on it.

06:35.050 --> 06:41.920
And once we have enabled the IRS and fully automated mode my virtual machines will start migrating around

06:41.920 --> 06:47.680
on my ESX I hosts according to what de-risk thinks is correct.

06:49.070 --> 06:58.810
So DNS uses Wii motion as its underlying mechanism and both the arrest and the motion require the center.

06:59.060 --> 07:05.110
So the center fails D.R. S does not operate de-risk doesn't work without the center.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.820
Neither does Wii motion.

07:08.830 --> 07:12.470
OK so in review and this lesson we learned a little bit about DRM.

07:12.490 --> 07:18.710
We learn how it can automatically Wii motion virtual machines across hosts for load balancing.

07:18.730 --> 07:25.090
We learned about anti affinity roles and how they can be used to segregate redundant VAMC and keep them

07:25.090 --> 07:27.040
on separate hosts.

07:27.040 --> 07:31.810
Another important characteristic of DRM is that it makes it really easy to put a host in a maintenance

07:31.810 --> 07:41.650
mode or do upgrades because we can use the press to automatically evacuate a host Dira supports a manual

07:42.020 --> 07:49.230
partially automated and fully automated phones and it can automatically evacuate and ESX I host when

07:49.230 --> 07:54.360
it's placed in maintenance mode to make things like Update Manager work better.

07:54.660 --> 08:01.350
And as we learn more and work our way throughout this course you'll see that Deros and high availability

08:01.620 --> 08:04.720
are two features that work really well together.

08:04.740 --> 08:09.870
So we haven't really covered H.A. yet but as we go a little further in this course we'll learn about

08:09.870 --> 08:11.870
how these two technologies work together.
