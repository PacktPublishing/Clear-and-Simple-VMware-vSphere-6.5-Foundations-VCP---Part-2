This video we'll look at some of the basic database management tasks required for VSE Hunter now and

00:08.530 --> 00:11.610
the center server appliance version 6.5.

00:11.620 --> 00:21.790
We have an embedded Wii postgresql database and this is simply a postgresql UL database that is customized

00:21.850 --> 00:26.140
and optimized for the Center Right.

00:26.140 --> 00:32.710
So it's a baked and database that is basically purpose built purely for the center.

00:32.710 --> 00:38.900
And so now we don't really have to rely on any sort of external databases.

00:38.980 --> 00:42.910
And of course the database is a critical piece of the center.

00:43.180 --> 00:50.200
You know many many organizations have a team of dbspace that are focused on architecting and optimizing

00:50.200 --> 00:51.060
databases.

00:51.950 --> 01:02.400
And so there may be some hesitance to off load this database maintenance type task to Avies for.

01:04.340 --> 01:06.820
But vendors made it very simple.

01:06.860 --> 01:07.120
Right.

01:07.130 --> 01:12.920
There's really not a lot of stuff that you have to think about when it comes to maintaining this database.

01:12.920 --> 01:17.540
Very it's very straightforward very simple and easy to manage.

01:17.540 --> 01:23.410
There are some tuning optimizations that kind of have happened behind the scenes here.

01:24.520 --> 01:30.180
So where has defined higher default values for certain critical settings.

01:30.520 --> 01:38.230
Some of the buffers and Checkpoint segments and other aspects of the database that optimally tune to

01:38.230 --> 01:40.490
work as a database for V Center.

01:40.550 --> 01:40.710
Right.

01:40.720 --> 01:43.070
So it's not just a generic database.

01:43.270 --> 01:50.970
It's a database that is purpose built to work as the ideal database for VSA under there we have a process

01:50.970 --> 01:59.180
called vacuuming so the postscripts QOL databases require periodic maintenance known as vacuuming.

01:59.340 --> 02:08.010
Vacuuming is used to recover or reuse disk space that was occupied by rows that have now been deleted

02:08.130 --> 02:14.430
or to update data statistics for queries or to update the visibility maps.

02:14.520 --> 02:18.840
So we have to do a periodic vacuuming process now.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.520
Now baked right into the center.

02:20.650 --> 02:27.690
There's actually an automated vacuuming process and so you can set up auto vacuuming and then you don't

02:27.690 --> 02:29.840
really even have to think about this.

02:30.060 --> 02:34.330
And of course one of the great things that are baked right into the center share of appliance as well

02:34.330 --> 02:37.600
is the ability to natively backup and restore.

02:37.700 --> 02:42.030
Right so we don't really even have to think about the database in that regard.

02:42.090 --> 02:49.440
And if we're using the center server high availability all of the data that's in the database is going

02:49.440 --> 02:56.430
to be synchronously replicated to to as standby the center instance.

02:56.430 --> 03:02.640
Right so all that stuff like database clustering and mirroring and replication of data we don't even

03:02.640 --> 03:07.460
have to think about that stuff when it comes to the center share of her appliance version 6.5.

03:07.710 --> 03:15.570
We can simply set it up do the occasional vacuuming task or set it up to automatically happen and then

03:15.570 --> 03:20.490
enable the center server high availability and that will handle all of the synchronous replication of

03:20.490 --> 03:21.700
data for us.

03:21.870 --> 03:23.220
And we don't even need to think about it.
