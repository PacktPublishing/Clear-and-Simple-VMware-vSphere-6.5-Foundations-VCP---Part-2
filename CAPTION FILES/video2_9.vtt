00:01.280 --> 00:08.660
High availability uses a mechanism called a data store heart beat as an additional way to validate if

00:08.660 --> 00:12.360
a host is truly failed or not.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.430
So let's take a look at our diagram here.

00:14.430 --> 00:22.290
And again you can see we have four ESX I hosts ESX 0 1 0 2 0 3 0 4 and they're all connected to a physical

00:22.290 --> 00:27.420
switch and they all have V.M. zero which is our management VM kernel port.

00:27.420 --> 00:30.910
So all of the hosts can send heartbeats to each other.

00:31.060 --> 00:36.640
And so the master is going to send solve the slaves and all of the slaves will send their heart beats

00:36.640 --> 00:37.690
to the master.

00:37.780 --> 00:41.110
And as long as this continues to be the case everything is fine.

00:43.500 --> 00:49.320
Let's assume that the management connection to ESX size 0 4 is broken.

00:50.750 --> 00:52.640
What is ESX 0 4.

00:52.650 --> 00:59.830
Actually down at this point it's not as like 0 4 is still up and running.

00:59.840 --> 01:05.220
There are still virtual machines that are potentially working on that host and maybe those VM even have

01:05.220 --> 01:07.420
a network connection that's still up.

01:07.500 --> 01:12.370
All of our traffic might not flow through that physical switch at the bottom of the diagram

01:15.280 --> 01:21.110
when that connection is broken when that management network connection is broken a few things will happen.

01:22.580 --> 01:28.860
The master host will try and ping ESX 0 4 and that will fail.

01:31.260 --> 01:40.950
The master hosts will then check the data store heartbeat of ESX size zero for and what I mean by the

01:40.950 --> 01:47.760
data store Harpy is each of these hosts has a little file called the lock file that it maintains on

01:47.760 --> 01:49.650
shared storage.

01:49.650 --> 01:57.530
And as long as it maintains that file and that file remains locked by the host the host must still be

01:57.530 --> 02:00.240
up and it must still have access to storage.

02:00.260 --> 02:08.300
So what the Master is doing is saying hey can I open the lock file for ESX 0 4 if it can't then it knows

02:08.300 --> 02:17.030
that ESX 0 4 is still maintaining a lock on that file and therefore the host is still up.

02:17.040 --> 02:23.840
So now the master host knows that ESX 0 4 isn't truly down.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.730
But that it's just isolated from the management network.

02:33.130 --> 02:35.100
So what happens in this scenario.

02:35.200 --> 02:37.470
This is considered a host isolation.

02:38.430 --> 02:47.520
So let's start by focusing on the master and slave hosts that a failed slave host ESX 0 4 has a broken

02:47.520 --> 02:49.210
management network connection.

02:52.170 --> 02:58.530
And at the moment the only thing we know for sure is that ESX I 0 4 can't connect to the management

02:58.530 --> 02:59.400
network.

02:59.610 --> 03:05.910
It might have other networks connected for virtual machines that are still up and running and we know

03:05.910 --> 03:10.620
that the host can still access storage based on our data store heartbeat.

03:10.620 --> 03:20.800
So we may not want to do anything to ESX 04 we may want to just continue to allow it to run as is the

03:20.800 --> 03:25.910
correct host isolation response really depends on your environment.

03:27.180 --> 03:30.660
What do you think is going on if the management network has failed.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.510
If the management network is down are your virtual machines most likely down.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.130
Does it run on the same network as your virtual machine traffic.

03:40.340 --> 03:40.520
Right.

03:40.520 --> 03:48.740
Once you answer these questions about your environment you can correctly choose the appropriate host

03:48.860 --> 03:53.870
isolation response and you centrally have three options.

03:55.410 --> 03:59.500
What this slave host can do is number one it can just leave the virtual machines running.

03:59.640 --> 03:59.850
Right.

03:59.850 --> 04:07.910
The slave host will realize that its isolated and it can either just leave those victims running as

04:07.910 --> 04:15.990
is option to is host ESX size or four can shut down those virtual machines and theyll boot up on some

04:15.990 --> 04:22.410
other host or the final option is to just power off the VMS without a graceful shutdown and boot them

04:22.410 --> 04:28.280
up on other hosts and all the virtual machines files are on shared storage right.

04:28.290 --> 04:35.190
So if those VMs get powered off or shut down another ESX host is going to be able to reach out and boot

04:35.250 --> 04:37.940
those VAMC up.

04:38.020 --> 04:46.990
So the correct decision to host isolation event really depends on what the architecture of your environment

04:46.990 --> 04:47.760
looks like.
