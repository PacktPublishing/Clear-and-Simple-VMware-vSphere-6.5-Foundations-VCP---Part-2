00:02.630 --> 00:08.410
In this video I'll demonstrate how to carry out of emotion migration of a virtual machine.

00:08.900 --> 00:13.980
So here you can see we have a virtual machine that's been created called the motion demo.

00:14.570 --> 00:20.590
And I have to ESX I hosts present in my cluster and you don't need a cluster for Wii motion.

00:20.630 --> 00:20.840
Right.

00:20.840 --> 00:24.860
Really the only thing you need for Wii motion is shared storage.

00:24.860 --> 00:31.790
A properly configured VM kernel port you need the center and you need the same networks on both the

00:31.790 --> 00:34.270
source and destination host.

00:34.340 --> 00:41.530
So at the moment I can see that this virtual machine is currently running on Host 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 9 9

00:41.540 --> 00:45.110
out 100 so it's running on my first host.

00:45.200 --> 00:53.790
Now I can just carry out a very simple Wii motion migration by right clicking this VM and choosing my

00:53.790 --> 00:59.380
great and the very first option is to change the compute resource only.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.390
That's an emotion right.

01:01.550 --> 01:08.240
I'm not moving the virtual disks from one data store to another and I'm not doing a storage Wii motion.

01:08.240 --> 01:13.220
I'm doing a Wii Motion I'm moving it from one ESX host to another.

01:13.460 --> 01:18.890
But all of the files that make up this VM are going to remain right on the same data store that they're

01:18.890 --> 01:20.290
currently on.

01:22.010 --> 01:32.020
So let's go ahead and hit Next here and my source host is 1 9 2 1 6 8 1 9 9 100 so I'm going to choose

01:32.020 --> 01:38.620
one or three as the destination and what you'll notice as soon as I click on one of the three down here

01:38.620 --> 01:46.930
in the compatibility area if there are any readily apparent problems that are going to cause this not

01:46.930 --> 01:53.210
to work those will show up there as a validation check is performed OK.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.670
So our compatibility checks have succeeded.

01:55.670 --> 01:58.890
There's nothing wrong here.

01:58.910 --> 02:05.300
OK so now that we've chosen the destination host on the next screen it's going to have us select the

02:05.300 --> 02:12.890
network that we want to connect to and you can see our source network is a group called 199 the destination

02:12.890 --> 02:17.360
network that we're going to choose is going to also be 1 9 9.

02:17.420 --> 02:23.890
But in this scenario that destination network is not actually available.

02:23.930 --> 02:26.060
The other ESX host.

02:26.530 --> 02:32.090
OK so let's take a moment and check this out and see what happens when we kind of minimize this task

02:32.960 --> 02:40.620
and go back and take a look at these two ESX host.

02:40.640 --> 02:47.950
OK so let's take a look at our destination host which is 1 9 2 1 6 8 8 1 9 9 1 0 3.

02:47.950 --> 02:53.890
And I want to look at our virtual switches and you can see here on VSE which is zero.

02:54.270 --> 02:57.220
We have one port group called V.M. network.

02:57.480 --> 03:05.300
Let's take a look at the other ESX I host this vse which we have two port groups.

03:05.300 --> 03:11.750
All right we've got the VM network and we've got port group 199 which is what our virtual machine is

03:11.750 --> 03:13.290
currently connected to.

03:13.320 --> 03:13.850
Right.

03:14.150 --> 03:17.070
And I'm going to quickly look at the info screen.

03:17.150 --> 03:18.560
All right.

03:18.560 --> 03:23.000
So on the source host this VM is connected to porker 199.

03:23.240 --> 03:26.530
And notice the security settings that are configured here.

03:26.930 --> 03:29.700
And notice the LAN configuration as well.

03:31.160 --> 03:40.730
When I take this VM and migrate it to Host 1 0 3 second host it has to have a port group that matches

03:40.790 --> 03:42.950
this configuration.

03:42.950 --> 03:49.310
So I'm going to set up a port group that is exactly the same on my destination host complete with the

03:49.310 --> 03:56.520
same name the same VPN membership and the same security settings.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.140
So let's call it 199.

03:58.190 --> 04:05.520
We'll make the release on 199 and we'll go ahead and hit finish here and then I'm going to quickly modify

04:08.050 --> 04:12.420
the security settings on this pop group as well so choose poor group 199.

04:12.820 --> 04:21.990
I had a little pencil or modify and will quickly change the security settings to match exactly what

04:22.650 --> 04:25.160
the porker on the other host is configured for.

04:25.350 --> 04:30.660
And I know this seems like kind of a long process to sort of pause and take a look at here but these

04:30.660 --> 04:37.610
are the sort of little inconsistencies across hosts that can create big V motion problems.

04:37.710 --> 04:38.370
Right.

04:38.370 --> 04:45.180
And so what we want to really think about is basically you want all of your hosts to be as similar as

04:45.180 --> 04:47.460
they possibly can.

04:47.490 --> 04:48.130
All right.

04:48.240 --> 04:55.420
Because as we move on in this video series you're going to see that things like deep grass and high

04:55.420 --> 05:04.500
availability are going to rely on all of these configurations being very consistent across your hosts.

05:04.590 --> 05:10.230
And so we always want to be very careful that maybe even using things like host profiles will allow

05:10.230 --> 05:13.300
us to kind of maintain that consistency.

05:16.960 --> 05:24.770
OK so now we've gone ahead and we've chosen our destination host we've chosen our destination network.

05:25.320 --> 05:29.850
And do we want to do a high priority Wii motion or lower priority Wii motion.

05:29.850 --> 05:34.430
Basically the high priority Wii motion chews up a little bit more C-p resources.

05:34.540 --> 05:38.640
So we're going to go with that and then I'm going to go ahead and finish here.

05:38.780 --> 05:42.140
And you should see it should happen very quickly.

05:42.140 --> 05:47.420
So I am going to go ahead and unpinned this and we're going to look at our recent tasks and look at

05:47.420 --> 05:49.270
that relocate virtual machine.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.210
It's already completed.

05:51.300 --> 05:53.850
It was cute for about 5 milliseconds.

05:53.870 --> 06:00.950
It started at 11:30 and 29 seconds in it finished at 11:30 and 32 seconds.

06:00.980 --> 06:06.170
So the whole process took us somewhere around three seconds.

06:06.210 --> 06:13.040
And now if I look at my Wii motion demo virtual machine I can see it's now on ESX I host 1 9 2 1 6 8

06:13.340 --> 06:16.560
1 9 9 1 or 3.

06:16.660 --> 06:23.160
So now that our virtual machine has been relocated tune into the next video where I'll show you how

06:23.160 --> 06:25.590
to carry out a scheduled migration.
