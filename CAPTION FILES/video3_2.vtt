00:01.160 --> 00:08.740
In this video I'll demonstrate how to verify the network configuration of ESX I hosts in a virtual machines

00:08.740 --> 00:09.440
as well.

00:10.320 --> 00:15.510
And all of this content is going to be represented on your sphere foundations exam.

00:15.510 --> 00:19.170
So let's start with our ESX I host.

00:19.170 --> 00:21.290
I'm going to go to hosts and questers.

00:21.570 --> 00:30.100
Pick out a host and let's go to configure and take a look at our ESX host and we'll go under the networking

00:30.100 --> 00:30.660
screen.

00:30.700 --> 00:34.440
And we're going to look at all of these different areas on our networking.

00:35.050 --> 00:38.700
So first off we have our virtual switches.

00:38.950 --> 00:44.660
You can click on a virtual switch and you can use any of the menu options here to make changes.

00:44.710 --> 00:44.880
Right.

00:44.890 --> 00:52.180
So the first menu option is the ADD networking option or if I want to create a new port group I can

00:52.180 --> 00:55.080
do that here right if I want to create a new VM kernel port.

00:55.360 --> 00:56.360
I can do that here.

00:56.590 --> 01:03.490
I if I want to create an entirely new virtual switch I'll choose this option create a new port group

01:04.170 --> 01:12.070
and then I'll choose to create it on a new standard switch so I can create either port groups VM kernel

01:12.070 --> 01:16.180
ports or an entirely new virtual switch using that option.

01:18.190 --> 01:21.720
Now if you hover over any of these buttons it'll tell you what they do.

01:21.820 --> 01:25.680
This one will refresh the hosts network system if I've made changes.

01:25.930 --> 01:31.230
And here I can manage the physical adapters for this particular virtual switch.

01:31.540 --> 01:40.220
So if I had additional physical adapters or VM Annex I could add those here to this virtual switch right.

01:40.250 --> 01:47.960
Each physical adapter of your ESX I host can only be assigned to one virtual switch.

01:48.380 --> 01:54.710
So for this host I have one physical adapter that physical adapter is assigned to this particular virtual

01:54.710 --> 01:55.580
switch.

01:56.910 --> 02:05.890
And if we look at some of the characteristics of this physical adapter we can see that it is actually

02:05.890 --> 02:07.600
a virtual device right.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.150
Were using it in this lab environment.

02:10.180 --> 02:19.420
ESX I host are actually virtual machines so you can see at this moment CGP and LDP have not been enabled.

02:19.420 --> 02:25.140
If they were we could see information about the physical switches that this host is connected to here.

02:25.240 --> 02:30.460
But like I said this this ESX I hope this is actually a virtual machine and its not really connected

02:30.460 --> 02:31.600
to a physical switch.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.420
This next button allows us to move our VM kernel ports around.

02:40.570 --> 02:46.600
So if I have a VM kernel port thats on one virtual switch and I want to move it to another virtual switch

02:46.960 --> 02:49.990
I can do that using this menu option.

02:50.380 --> 02:56.860
And if I want to edit my virtual switch itself lets with the pencil icon for so I can edit things like

02:56.860 --> 03:02.340
the maximum transmission unit I can edit things like security settings right.

03:02.350 --> 03:07.830
I can go ahead and reject MAC address changes and forged transmits if I don't need those things.

03:09.450 --> 03:16.210
I can configure traffic shaping or nic teaming and fail over and a lot of these topics are covered in

03:16.210 --> 03:18.820
the other videos that are part of this course.

03:18.820 --> 03:25.180
So if you're not familiar with the different load balancing mechanisms or the different way that network

03:25.180 --> 03:32.550
failure detection is performed check out the other videos in this course.

03:32.750 --> 03:36.230
But I want to move on now I want to take a look at the VM kernel ports.

03:36.230 --> 03:40.580
All right so here we have a VM kernel port called V case 0.

03:41.060 --> 03:45.340
And I'm going to go ahead and add it does VM kernel port.

03:45.600 --> 03:52.820
And here we can see all of the services that are enabled on this VM kernel port it so I could enable

03:52.820 --> 03:59.030
V.M. Colonel Portes specifically for virtual sceneries for replication or fault tolerance or management

03:59.030 --> 04:00.820
or emotion.

04:04.370 --> 04:08.290
If we look at the nix settings we can see the empty you for the VM kernel port.

04:08.720 --> 04:15.050
We can see the IP address and at the moment we're actually obtaining the IP version 4 settings automatically.

04:15.050 --> 04:18.400
I could statically configure it as well if I wanted to.

04:19.920 --> 04:22.470
And I'll go ahead and hit OK here.

04:22.500 --> 04:27.540
Now you want to be careful when you're working with the management VM kernel port because if you make

04:27.540 --> 04:31.470
a mistake here you're going to lose management access to the host.

04:31.590 --> 04:36.520
And so therefore you won't be able to manage it with the center or the vees fair web client anymore.

04:39.270 --> 04:41.170
Here are my physical adapters for this host.

04:41.180 --> 04:49.970
We've already looked at these a little bit and then I can see the TCAP IP configuration for this host.

04:50.020 --> 04:59.990
So there are multiple network stacks available in your ESX I hosts and vice versa stuff five the default

04:59.990 --> 05:03.230
stack is used for everything by default.

05:03.230 --> 05:10.100
All right so what we mean by different network stacks is we can assign different DNS servers we can

05:10.100 --> 05:17.400
assign different default gateways we can have different routing tables for different types of traffic.

05:17.900 --> 05:24.800
So if I wanted to send all of my Wii motion traffic over a different network I could do that I could

05:24.800 --> 05:31.460
create a different TCAP IP stack configuration and then associate it with the motion so that all my

05:31.460 --> 05:34.970
view motion traffic goes over one specific network

05:39.220 --> 05:46.750
and that's really the host specific configuration here for my networking settings.

05:46.770 --> 05:50.420
You can see here we can configure routing IP version 4.

05:50.490 --> 05:58.350
So if you wanted to do something like change the DNS server that might ESX I host points to we can go

05:58.350 --> 06:00.930
here we can edit this TZP IP stack.

06:01.080 --> 06:10.250
We can modify the DNS server we can modify the routing settings and change the default gateway.

06:10.730 --> 06:13.800
And we can modify our advanced configurations here as well.

06:16.420 --> 06:22.000
And my second host is configured pretty much identically very similar configuration.

06:22.030 --> 06:24.400
We have one VM kernel port on that host as well.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.170
And one virtual switch.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.180
So that's the basics of the ESX host configuration.

06:31.180 --> 06:36.030
So if you want to verify the network configuration of a host this is how you do it.

06:36.040 --> 06:41.680
Now there's one final setting that I do want to take a little bit of time to delve into.

06:42.780 --> 06:44.990
Maximum transmission unit.

06:45.480 --> 06:52.320
The main thing that you want to be aware of here is we want to make sure that we're configuring an empty

06:52.320 --> 06:56.210
view that is consistent.

06:56.220 --> 07:03.810
So for example if I enable jumbo frames on this virtual switch and this virtual switch has a physical

07:03.810 --> 07:09.970
adapter or it has a VM Nic and that VM Nic is connected to a physical switch.

07:10.100 --> 07:17.340
Right here is my physical adapter that physical switch also needs to have that empty you of 9000.

07:17.340 --> 07:23.880
That's really important because if it doesn't we're going to run into connectivity problems there.

07:24.000 --> 07:31.130
When you have a mismatch in the MT you settings it can result in a couple of different scenarios.

07:31.140 --> 07:31.770
Right.

07:31.770 --> 07:41.240
Number one it can break network connectivity entirely or number two it can result in what we call fragmentation

07:41.360 --> 07:42.590
and re-assembly.
