In this video explain enhanced Wii motion compatibility or EVC in VSE fair sex.

00:08.260 --> 00:14.650
Now in this lesson we're going to cover a few topics we'll talk about how EVC is used to ensure that

00:14.680 --> 00:18.280
all of the hosts in a cluster are Wii motion compatible.

00:18.490 --> 00:24.400
And this is ideal if you have a depressed cluster that's going to be automatically moving virtual machines

00:24.400 --> 00:27.510
around using Wii motion.

00:27.550 --> 00:36.110
It also provides some additional levels of compatibility for Sipa use that would not normally be compatible.

00:36.120 --> 00:39.990
It also prevents incompatible hosts from being added to a cluster.

00:39.990 --> 00:46.650
So if you try to add a new host to an existing cluster and that new host is not emotion compatible EVC

00:46.650 --> 00:54.150
won't allow you to add it to that cluster EVC can be configured on clusters that include either AMD

00:54.510 --> 00:56.630
or Intel processors.

00:59.510 --> 01:06.650
So before we get into EVC Let's quickly talk about what a cluster is we can cluster our ESX I hostes

01:06.650 --> 01:14.360
for a number of purposes maybe we want to protect against a host failure using high availability.

01:14.360 --> 01:21.440
Maybe we want to automatically load balance across a group of hosts using DRM us or maybe we want to

01:21.440 --> 01:28.260
pool local storage and use it to present a shared data store using VSAN.

01:28.460 --> 01:38.400
These are all use cases that we can take advantage of when we create a host cluster.

01:38.410 --> 01:40.200
So how about DRM.

01:40.330 --> 01:46.450
Let's say that we've created a host cluster and we've been able to fully automated Diyar rests on that

01:46.450 --> 01:51.500
cluster Well Diyar wrasse relies upon wiii motion.

01:51.520 --> 01:53.370
That's how the IRS works.

01:54.070 --> 02:01.440
So with the IRS the center is going to constantly analyze the workloads of your ESX host and use Wii

02:01.480 --> 02:08.010
motion to move virtual machines from one host to another for load balancing purposes.

02:08.040 --> 02:13.330
However here we see a cluster with hosts that are Wii motion incompatible.

02:13.480 --> 02:13.950
You can't.

02:13.950 --> 02:21.660
The motion of virtual machine from an HMD host to an Intel host and EVC can't really help with this.

02:21.690 --> 02:28.440
If you've created this closter this is a cluster that contains incompatible hosts and you can not enable

02:28.770 --> 02:31.410
EVC on this cluster.

02:31.410 --> 02:36.620
So even as he can fix some of the motion incompatibilities but it can't fix everything

02:42.440 --> 02:47.540
so here we see a cluster of ESX I host and they're all HMD hosts.

02:47.540 --> 02:50.120
This is rephrased.

02:50.870 --> 02:52.230
This is a closter.

02:52.340 --> 03:00.460
That's a good candidate for EVC when we can figure EVC we'll choose a baseline.

03:00.830 --> 03:10.430
And all the hosts in that cluster will present the feature set of that baseline and EVC uses his built

03:10.430 --> 03:21.030
in technology with am d or Intel processors to create a consistent feature set across ESX I host.

03:21.050 --> 03:22.900
So how do they do this.

03:23.150 --> 03:31.580
Well in order to accomplish this newer processor features have to be masked so that they can match up

03:31.580 --> 03:35.070
with the older C-p use.

03:35.190 --> 03:42.630
So you'll choose a baseline of an older processor or at the baseline that you choose must be supported

03:42.930 --> 03:48.900
by the host with the smallest feature set in that cluster.

03:48.900 --> 03:53.400
Now this doesn't slow down your C.P. use it doesn't throttle them back.

03:53.400 --> 04:01.470
It doesn't make an AMDP generation one processor perform like a generation three or vice versa.

04:01.950 --> 04:08.580
What it does is it masks certain features so that all of the processors kind of feel the same to our

04:08.620 --> 04:11.480
venoms.

04:11.540 --> 04:13.400
So let's take a look at our slide here.

04:13.430 --> 04:21.470
We have four ESX I hosts and we've chosen a baseline that matches up with the host with the smallest

04:21.470 --> 04:24.310
feature set HMD generation one.

04:24.410 --> 04:26.940
That's our baseline.

04:27.000 --> 04:34.500
So the end result of this baseline is that the features that are not supported on Generation 1 are not

04:34.500 --> 04:35.620
available.

04:35.820 --> 04:43.650
And now my virtual machines get an identical experience on any of these hosts and we motion compatibility

04:43.650 --> 04:45.680
is achieved.

04:45.700 --> 04:52.570
So that's one of the big benefits of EVC is it can make hosts that are normally not the motion compatible

04:53.010 --> 04:55.230
the motion compatible.

04:55.240 --> 05:01.930
Now a few final notes on EVC EVC does have some hardware requirements that need to be met.

05:02.020 --> 05:06.490
You must be on ESX I 3.5 or later I'm sure we're all on that.

05:06.670 --> 05:09.120
All C-p use must be from a single vendor.

05:09.130 --> 05:17.800
You can't mix and match AMD and Intel Intel Core 2 processors are supported by EVC beginning with the

05:17.800 --> 05:19.830
Merom generation.

05:20.170 --> 05:27.390
Am D has two different sequences of EVC levels each of which support different generations of processors.

05:27.620 --> 05:34.410
There's HMD level one which supports HMD Opteron generation one through three.

05:34.510 --> 05:42.280
And there's HMD level B which supports Opteron generation 3:55 C.P. use with the 3D now feature are

05:42.280 --> 05:43.320
not it.
