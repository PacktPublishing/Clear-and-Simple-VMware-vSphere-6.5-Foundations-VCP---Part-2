00:01.030 --> 00:06.130
In this video I'll demonstrate how to work with alarms and vse fair.

00:06.340 --> 00:13.000
And the first step is to make sure that we've got the center properly configured right so that's always

00:13.000 --> 00:20.080
going to be the first and most critical step because if alarm's get generated we need to be notified

00:20.080 --> 00:21.260
of them somehow.

00:21.380 --> 00:29.970
We want to get an e-mail address or we want an asinine P-trap to be sent to our SMP server.

00:30.070 --> 00:34.750
So we have a couple of different options of how we can get these messages through to us.

00:35.020 --> 00:39.820
But none of those options are going to work unless we've properly configured the center to be able to

00:39.820 --> 00:42.190
send those types of messages.

00:43.380 --> 00:49.710
So here you can see I'm in the hosts and Questors view I clicked on my v center server I clicked on

00:50.310 --> 01:00.500
settings and other general settings I clicked on it and we can modify the A.P. host.

01:00.620 --> 01:07.400
So for example I could put in my email server here I could say that the email is going to be sent in

01:07.400 --> 01:19.670
from service at trayner tests dot com and now I've got the ability to allow the sender to actually send

01:19.670 --> 01:21.620
out alerts to my email address.

01:21.950 --> 01:29.310
And most smartphones have an email address that you can also utilize to send text messages.

01:29.360 --> 01:34.190
So if you want the alerts to go to your phone via text you just need to find out the email address for

01:34.190 --> 01:38.390
your phone to receive text messages on and set that up here.

01:39.600 --> 01:39.860
All right.

01:39.870 --> 01:42.410
Or you can set up an SMP host.

01:42.420 --> 01:49.590
So if I happen to have an Ensign and the host in my environment that I want to configure and send traps

01:49.590 --> 01:52.520
to I can set that up here.

01:52.530 --> 02:00.630
So that's really step one of configuring alerts in the center is to make sure that the center itself

02:00.690 --> 02:08.520
is properly configured to send any of these triggered alarms to the appropriate resources.

02:08.520 --> 02:13.890
Now that we've covered kind of the basic first step here of setting up alarming itself let's take a

02:13.890 --> 02:19.300
moment to look at some of the alarms that we can create and how we can create them.

02:19.320 --> 02:26.010
So here at the V.A. center level we can go ahead and look at the alarm definitions and you'll see a

02:26.010 --> 02:31.070
bunch of alarms that are predefined built right into the center.

02:31.080 --> 02:38.830
So for example let's pick one here called Data Store let's look for any alarms.

02:38.860 --> 02:40.380
Specific to data stores.

02:40.450 --> 02:43.260
And here we go a data store capacity alarm.

02:43.840 --> 02:52.240
Right so this is an alarm that is going to trigger if my data store is running low on disk space and

02:52.260 --> 02:59.070
I can click Edit and take a look at the specific settings of this particular alarm it's going to trigger

02:59.070 --> 03:07.500
based on an event and the event is if I'm getting this system capability warnings from the storage provider.

03:07.740 --> 03:14.580
So basically if the storage array itself is telling me that we're running out of space let's take a

03:14.580 --> 03:16.250
look at an even simpler alarm.

03:16.320 --> 03:19.540
Here we see data store usage on disk.

03:19.800 --> 03:26.510
And this is a conditional arm and it's going to trigger if my data stores more than 75 percent fault

03:26.660 --> 03:29.240
I will send a warning if my data stores.

03:29.310 --> 03:33.930
Eighty five percent full or more it'll send a critical alert.

03:34.110 --> 03:37.660
And what is it going to do in those situations.

03:40.740 --> 03:44.750
We'll see an alert here in the east for a web client but it's not going to send me an e-mail.

03:44.750 --> 03:51.510
It's not going to send in S and P-trap unless I specifically go in here and configure an action for

03:51.510 --> 04:00.290
this alarm say let's send a notification e-mail to service at trayner tests dot com

04:03.150 --> 04:09.150
So that's an important thing to understand about the alarms that are baked right into the center is

04:09.150 --> 04:14.060
the fact that you know they're not really going to send you any kind of alert.

04:14.270 --> 04:14.780
Right.

04:14.830 --> 04:20.560
There's no alerts that's going to go to your e-mail or your SMP server by default.

04:20.640 --> 04:22.400
You need to set those actions up

04:25.460 --> 04:28.640
and you also need to set those actions up if you're creating a new alarm.

04:28.640 --> 04:40.420
So let's set up a new alarm and I'm going to set up an alarm called the CPQ over 95 percent maybe I

04:40.420 --> 04:48.400
want to know if my virtual machines are going over ninety 95 percent and CPQ I'm going to enable this

04:48.400 --> 04:56.110
alarm so that it's turned on and I am going to monitor for a condition and the condition that I'm going

04:56.110 --> 05:01.110
to Maatta monitor for is virtual machines usage.

05:01.660 --> 05:07.480
If it's over 95 percent that's all I care about in this case so I'm going to make these two criteria

05:07.480 --> 05:09.200
exactly the same.

05:09.390 --> 05:17.780
If it's over 95 percent for five minutes I want to get these alerts.

05:18.170 --> 05:19.780
And so that's my trigger.

05:20.600 --> 05:26.000
If those criteria are met this alarm will trigger and it's going to force me to use slightly different

05:26.000 --> 05:26.410
values.

05:26.430 --> 05:33.730
Ok so I'll change the the warning to something a little bit lower here.

05:38.150 --> 05:41.320
94 percent OK.

05:41.790 --> 05:44.160
And so now I've created the triggers.

05:44.160 --> 05:44.460
Right.

05:44.460 --> 05:48.460
Those are the things that are basically going to set this alarm off.

05:48.690 --> 05:51.360
And so what do I want to have happen.

05:51.360 --> 05:51.750
All right.

05:51.990 --> 05:53.930
And maybe I only really want to be notified.

05:53.950 --> 05:55.660
Ninety five percent.

05:55.980 --> 06:01.240
So I will say you know send an e-mail to my e-mail address.

06:01.470 --> 06:09.570
Once we hit that 95 percent mark I don't really care about the 94 percent mark so I'm not going to set

06:09.570 --> 06:11.240
any notifications for that.

06:12.310 --> 06:13.420
And is warning me here.

06:13.500 --> 06:18.540
I never really configured an e-mail server in the center so I have to do that.

06:18.550 --> 06:22.360
But that's a really simple condition.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.550
Alarm.

06:23.650 --> 06:27.900
And when I create this alarm let me go back to the main screen of the alarm.

06:28.060 --> 06:34.840
I'm going to name it something a little bit more descriptive called Rick demo alarm just so that I can

06:34.840 --> 06:41.430
show you how this alarm gets propagated.

06:41.490 --> 06:52.890
So now I've created an alarm and the center itself so if any of these victims that are sub objects go

06:52.890 --> 07:01.170
over 95 percent CPQ that's going to trigger my alarm this alarm that I created here is going to be propagated

07:01.170 --> 07:03.840
down to this ha cluster.

07:03.840 --> 07:10.420
And let's look at our alarm definitions under H.A. cluster and it's also going to be propagated down

07:10.420 --> 07:20.560
to all of the ESX hosts and all of the virtual machines that are managed by this vse center Scherrer.

07:20.580 --> 07:24.290
So here we see the Rick DMO alarm on the H.A. cluster.

07:24.350 --> 07:29.770
If I look at an individual host the alarm is going to be propagated down to those hosts as well.

07:29.790 --> 07:37.870
So if I want to create a global alarm I'll create it at the center level and when I create those alarms

07:37.930 --> 07:42.370
I will specify exactly what they're going to be monitoring.

07:42.410 --> 07:47.300
Right so my Rick demo alarm is monitoring virtual machines.

07:47.470 --> 07:51.620
So now that I've configured one alarm lets configure one more alarm.

07:51.670 --> 07:56.660
I'm going to configure this one on the H.A. cluster instead of at the center level.

07:56.680 --> 08:02.980
Who knows maybe I have multiple clusters where I want to configure different alarms and I want to create

08:02.980 --> 08:11.210
an alarm that is going to notify me whenever and ESX host goes into maintenance mode.

08:11.260 --> 08:14.860
So I'm going to monitor for a specific event.

08:15.190 --> 08:21.380
It is not a condition a host entering maintenance mode is a one time event.

08:21.380 --> 08:25.810
It's not an ongoing condition like high Seip you use your high memory usage.

08:25.820 --> 08:27.010
It's an event.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.250
So we're going to monitor for that event.

08:29.300 --> 08:36.990
We're going to monitor our ESX I host and I'll set up my alarm trigger to say if a host has entered

08:36.990 --> 08:39.380
maintenance mode I want to trigger the alarm

08:44.220 --> 08:44.810
Riego.

08:45.020 --> 08:53.000
So now I've created my trigger saying if the host enters maintenance mode I want this alarm to be triggered

08:54.020 --> 08:56.260
and I want it to send me an email.

08:56.270 --> 09:03.500
Create an S and M P-trap or I can set up all sorts of other actions here as well.

09:03.520 --> 09:03.920
Right.

09:04.060 --> 09:08.390
Things like taking the host out of standby mode which really wouldn't be applicable here.

09:08.410 --> 09:11.500
But exiting main mode rebooting the host.

09:11.570 --> 09:11.750
Right.

09:11.790 --> 09:15.880
Maybe we want to automatically reboot the host if it gets put maintenance mode.

09:15.880 --> 09:16.940
Probably not.

09:17.380 --> 09:23.110
But I just wanted to show you this so that you could kind of get a feel for the many types of alarm

09:23.110 --> 09:25.010
actions that can be carried out.

09:25.150 --> 09:28.310
And there's alarm actions for virtual machines as well.

09:28.370 --> 09:38.280
Right so if we wanted to let's say create a virtual machine alarm that monitor for Migration resource

09:38.280 --> 09:40.710
error migration warning it doesn't really matter.

09:40.800 --> 09:45.960
We go to the next screen we can set up all sorts of actions on our virtual machines.

09:45.960 --> 09:51.780
Right we can have them get rebooted we can run a command on them we can suspend them we can migrate

09:51.790 --> 09:53.270
them.

09:53.450 --> 09:58.320
So alarm actions aren't really just notifications.

09:58.340 --> 10:03.120
There's all sorts of actions that you can carry out on hosts or on virtual machines.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.120
Automatically if an alarm was triggered.
